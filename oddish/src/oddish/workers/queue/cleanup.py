"""Unified cleanup sweep for the `worker_jobs` queue.

Before the unified refactor this module had five separate steps, one
per domain table flavor (running-trials, stale-analysis,
stale-verdict, stage-transition, orphaned-slots). They all collapse
into two kind-agnostic passes now:

1. **Zombie 'idle in transaction' reaper**. Unchanged; runs first so
   its ``AccessShareLock``s don't block the UPDATEs below. Safe to
   run on every dispatcher tick.
2. **Stale-heartbeat sweep on worker_jobs**. One query transitions
   every RUNNING row whose heartbeat stalled into RETRYING (if
   retries remain) or FAILED. Per-kind domain-row cleanup is driven
   off the returned rows.

The stage-transition helpers (``maybe_start_qa_stage`` /
``maybe_advance_legacy_analyzing_task``) still run as a safety net so
tasks with all trials done can't get stuck if a single stage-transition
flush failed at handler-commit time.

# tasks) can never reach the verdict stage. For stale ANALYZING tasks with
# nothing analysis- or trial-side still in flight, we mark the lingering NULL
# analysis terminal (it will never run) so the normal advance carries them to
# VERDICT_PENDING; tasks with no live trials left are finalized FAILED. Only
