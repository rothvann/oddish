"""File provenance counted from a trajectory, never inferred by a model.

Sibling of :mod:`trajectory_delegation`, for the same reason and by the same rule: a fact
that is arithmetic over tool calls should not be a judgement call.

The labels that ask for provenance are the least reproducible in the taxonomy.
Summarizing 100 trials twice under identical input and comparing per step:

    plan_correction          36.4% reproducible   ("needs an earlier plan")
    implementing_correction  59.6%                ("the agent's OWN earlier edit")
    testing_custom           66.3%                ("scripts the agent wrote itself")

against `reading_files` at 78.1% and `writing_report` at 87.3%. The pattern is
not difficulty, it is bookkeeping: each of those definitions asks the model to
remember, across a 300-step trajectory in a single pass, who authored a thing.
That is a scan, and a scan is what code is for.

Only agents with structured file tools can be measured this way. `codex`
(`shell`), `mini-swe-agent` (`bash`) and `terminus-2` (`bash_command`) route
every write through a shell string, so their provenance is genuinely unknown
and is reported as None -- never as False, which would read as "the agent did
not revisit its own work" when the truth is that we cannot see.

The same caution applies WITHIN a capable agent: claude-code issues far more
Bash calls than Edit/Write calls, so a file created by a heredoc is invisible
here. Every field is therefore True-or-None. A positive is evidence; the
absence of one is not evidence of absence.
