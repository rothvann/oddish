"""Write-through + rebuild maintenance for the ``trial_facets`` vocabulary.

The task browser's filter dropdowns need the distinct facet values an org has
run (agent, model, provider, ...). Deriving them from ``trials`` on every
facets request scanned the whole org history seven times per page view;
``trial_facets`` (see :class:`oddish.db.models.TrialFacetModel`) stores the
tiny vocabulary instead. Two writers keep it correct:

* :func:`record_trial_facets` — write-through at trial creation, so a value
  is filterable the moment its first trial is queued or imported. Additive
  only, idempotent (``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``), and best-effort by
  contract: it must never abort the trial transaction it rides in.
* :func:`rebuild_trial_facets_core` — the periodic sweep's mark-and-prune
  reconciliation from one grouped scan over live trials. This is the
  exactness authority: it adds anything write-through missed (e.g.
  ``harbor_stage`` progressing during execution, classifications written by
  analyzers) and prunes values whose last trial was deleted, superseded, or
  left behind by a version bump — without ever holding locks a trial writer
  would wait on.

Freshness contract: spec facets (agent/model/pair/provider/environment) are
instant; stage/classification additions and every removal converge within one
sweep interval (plus the prune grace). Between sweeps the vocabulary may
over-include — an option whose trials just vanished yields an empty (not
wrong) filter result.
