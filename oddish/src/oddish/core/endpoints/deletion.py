    trials (the grid reaches those through the task row; the cost rollup
    counts active membership rows), leaving the task row -- and its
    trials/links in every *other* experiment -- untouched. This is the tool for pulling a
    **shared** task out of one experiment, where a whole-task
    :func:`delete_task_core` would wrongly remove it from the others.

    Like the other delete cores this is tombstone-based: rows keep
    ``deleted_at = NOW()`` (the session-level filter in
    :mod:`oddish.db.soft_delete` then hides them), S3 artifacts are
    preserved, and the response carries an empty ``s3_prefixes`` list so the
    API layer's best-effort S3 cleanup is a no-op.

    The experiment-scoped trials are tombstoned alongside the link so the
    experiment stays internally consistent: the experiment task list is
    driven by the join row (so dropping it removes the empty task row), but
    the dashboard trial counts are keyed off ``trials.experiment_id``, so
    leaving those trials behind would show "no task but N trials". When the
    trials were already removed separately this step is a no-op and only the
    association is dropped.

    The task row is **never** tombstoned here, even if removing this
    membership leaves it with no experiments -- that is the whole point of
    the operation. Callers who want the entire task gone use
    :func:`delete_task_core`.
