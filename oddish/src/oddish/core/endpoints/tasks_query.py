    Beyond the free-text / tag / author filters, the browser supports a set of
    "Phase 1.1.1" direct filters that require no schema change:

    * Task-column filters (``statuses``, ``priorities``, ``verdict_statuses``,
      ``has_link``, ``run_analysis``, ``run_probe``, ``created_after`` /
      ``created_before``, ``experiment_ids``) are plain ``WHERE`` predicates on
      the ``tasks`` row.
    * Trial-level filters (``agents``, ``models``, ``trial_finished_*``, ``providers``,
      ``environments``, ``trial_statuses``, ``origins``, ``trial_is_probe``,
      ``harbor_*``, ``analysis_classifications``, ``has_error``,
      ``has_trajectory``, ``min_attempts``, token / step / reward ranges) are
      "task has at least one current-version trial matching X" — expressed as a
      correlated ``EXISTS`` over ``trials`` (non-superseded, current version,
      non-probe unless ``trial_is_probe`` is set). They filter the task set; they
      are NOT aggregates, so e.g. a token range matches a single trial's value,
      not the task average.
    * "Phase 1.2-lite" AGGREGATE filters/sort (``avg_score_*``, ``total_tokens_*``,
      ``*_trials_min``, ``pass/partial/fail/harness_count_min``, ``runtime_*``,
      ``sort``) are computed on the fly by ``_task_metrics_subquery`` — a single
      GROUP BY over the same scoped trial set — and applied as HAVING-equivalent
      predicates before pagination. There is NO supporting index or roll-up; this
      is the deliberately-slow path that full Phase 1.2 will denormalize. Cost sort
      uses persisted costs plus the same token estimates shown on task cards.
