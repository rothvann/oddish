"""Real older-Harbor end-to-end check for the ephemeral engine.

Spawns the ACTUAL child via ``uv run --no-project --with "harbor @ git+...@<sha>"
--python 3.13`` against a real older Harbor commit on the locked fork, proving
the override env resolves+builds, the standalone child imports that Harbor and
runs Harbor's ``Job`` API, and the parent bridges its outcome back. The task is
intentionally invalid so the run fails fast (no Docker build / API keys needed);
what's validated is the uv-child-bridge round trip, not a green trial.

Needs network + uv (first run resolves the env, ~15s; cached after). Skipped
automatically if uv is unavailable.
