# Oddish Backend

Serverless API and worker orchestration for Oddish Cloud, deployed on [Modal](https://modal.com), with multi-tenant authentication and authorization.

## Overview

The backend wraps the OSS `oddish` core with:
- Multi-tenant API (`org_id`-scoped queries)
- Dual auth (API keys + Clerk JWTs)
- Modal-hosted API/workers/sandboxes, or Railway/Docker for standalone deployment
- Queue-key concurrency controls
- Public token-based sharing endpoints

## System Architecture

### Data flow

```
User (Dashboard, CLI, SDK)
  │
  ▼
Modal API (FastAPI in `endpoints.py` and `api/routers/*`)
  │  - Auth: API key or Clerk JWT
  │  - Enqueues trial and task QA work as worker_jobs rows
  ▼
Postgres
  - worker_jobs   (unified queue, including TRIAL / QA / TASK_EXPAND)
  - trials/tasks  (domain state + live UI columns)
  - queue_slots   (per-queue-key concurrency leases)
  + cloud tables  (orgs / users / api_keys)
  │
  ▼
Scheduled functions
  ├─ poll_queue
  │    - Discovers active queue keys from worker_jobs
  │    - Spawns single-job Modal containers per queue key
  ├─ reconcile_queue_state
  │    - Runs cleanup, stage safety nets, and owner backfill
  └─ process_single_job
       - Acquires a queue_slots lease
       - Claims ONE worker_jobs row (any kind)
       - Dispatches to the registered handler
       - Writes heartbeats, records outcome, exits
  ▼
Harbor execution on Modal, Daytona, or opt-in ephemeral EC2
  - logs/artifacts persisted to S3
```

### Worker architecture

Dispatcher + single-job pattern backed by the unified `worker_jobs` table:

1. `poll_queue()` runs on a 180s Modal schedule. It discovers active queue
   keys via `discover_active_worker_job_queue_keys` and launches up to
   `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL` single-job containers.
2. `reconcile_queue_state()` runs separately. It calls
   `cleanup_orphaned_queue_state` (zombie-txn reap, stale-heartbeat sweep,
   stage safety nets, orphaned-slot release) and runs the experiments owner
   backfill (dashboard Mine fast path).
3. `process_single_job(queue_key)` acquires a `queue_slots` lease for the
   queue key and calls `run_single_worker_job`, which atomically claims one
   row from `worker_jobs`, dispatches to the registered handler
  (`TRIAL` / `QA` / `TASK_EXPAND` / `TAG_PROJECT`), writes heartbeats to both
   `worker_jobs.heartbeat_at` and the mirrored domain column, records the
   outcome, runs the post-success hook, releases the lease, and exits.

Post-success hooks for `TRIAL`, `QA`, and transitional `ANALYSIS` rows are
threaded through so GitHub notifications fire after the row is `SUCCESS`.
Handlers are registered at module load via `ensure_builtin_handlers_registered()`
so every container has
`TRIAL`, `QA`, `TASK_EXPAND`, `TAG_PROJECT`, and transitional `ANALYSIS`
wired up before any claim. Adding a new kind (e.g. `QA_REVIEW`) is one
handler class plus a `register` call — no new claim SQL, cleanup step, or
dispatcher branch.

## Authentication Model

The backend accepts auth from `Authorization`, `X-Clerk-Authorization`, or `X-Authorization`.

### API keys (programmatic access)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ok_abc123..." "$API_URL/tasks"
```

- Key format starts with `ok_`
- Stored hashed (SHA-256) in `api_keys`
- Scope options: `full`, `tasks`, `read`

### Clerk JWTs (dashboard access)

- Validated against Clerk JWKS
- Organization context extracted from token claims
- User and org membership resolved to internal auth context

### Auth flow

1. Read token from accepted header.
2. If token starts with `ok_`, validate API key and scope.
3. Otherwise validate Clerk JWT and resolve org/user.
4. Return auth context (`org_id`, `user_id`, `scope`) to route handlers.

If a Clerk JWT arrives without an `org_id`, the backend will try to resolve a
single existing org membership and, if none exists, provision a personal org for
that user.

## Multi-tenancy

All task/trial/experiment access is org-scoped. Cloud-side schema adds:

- `experiments.org_id`
- `tasks.org_id`, `tasks.created_by_user_id`, `tasks.task_s3_key`
- `trials.org_id`, `trials.trial_s3_key`

The API layer enforces this scope in all list/read/write queries.

## Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Use `backend/.env.example` as the starting point for local backend config.
For the API and worker runtime, the minimum required values are:

- `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL`
- `CLERK_DOMAIN`

Required for Clerk-backed org invites, membership lookups, and GitHub username enrichment:

- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

Required if you want Clerk webhook ingestion enabled:

- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

S3-compatible storage is **required**. Task bundles and trial artifacts are
uploaded directly from the client to S3 via presigned PUT URLs, and the
backend streams logs/results/files back through the same bucket. You must
configure the full `ODDISH_S3_*` set:

- `ODDISH_S3_BUCKET`
- `ODDISH_S3_REGION`
- `ODDISH_S3_ACCESS_KEY`
- `ODDISH_S3_SECRET_KEY`
- `ODDISH_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` (for non-AWS S3-compatible providers)

Common optional settings:

- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `CLERK_ISSUER`
- `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- provider keys such as `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `ODDISH_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENTS`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `DAYTONA_API_KEY`
- `ODDISH_OPENAI_PROVIDER=openai` plus `OPENAI_API_KEY` only when intentionally routing OpenAI-family jobs to public OpenAI
- GitHub notifier settings such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `ODDISH_DASHBOARD_URL`
- `SLACK_ALERT_BOT_TOKEN` (scopes `chat:write`, `im:write`, `users:read.email`) for deterministic cost alerts, which DM an experiment's owner: a milestone for each $1,000 spent in the past 24 hours, and any trial over $200 that finished in that window. The same token delivers the other DM-only alerts -- trial failed, QA failed, experiment failed -- and resolves in-channel mentions by account email. The email delivery channel has been removed entirely. `SLACK_EXPENSE_WEBHOOK_URL` carries what is left in-channel: unpriceable-model alerts from the past 24 hours; an escalation when a running or retrying trial's live cost rises above the configured floor, which `<@...>`-mentions its owner plus the always-ping list; and a `<!channel>` alert when a user's rolling seven-day spend, including live running-trial checkpoints, rises more than the configured dollar delta above their workspace's average spender. The two channel escalation thresholds and the ping list are set by an admin on the Costs tab of `/admin` and stored in `slack_alert_settings`; the constants in `slack_alert_settings.py` are the defaults they override, and no setting here is environment-configurable. Weekly user alerts re-arm after spend drops back below the threshold. The per-user DM cutoffs (the milestone and completed-trial floor) are separate deploy-time constants in `user_alert_prefs.py` that each person tunes in their own notification settings, not admin-editable here. Notifications are on by default for the production app; previews opt in with `ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS=true` and can attach a preview-only notification secret via `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSE_SECRET_NAME` / `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSE_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT`.
- `ODDISH_SLACK_UNFURL_*` for a lean, single-workspace Slack app that unfurls Oddish task, experiment, and public-share links. It requires `links:read` and `links:write`, a `link_shared` event subscription pointed at `/webhooks/slack/events`, a signing secret, bot token, and bound Oddish org. Optional team/channel allowlists add defense in depth. This is separate from the expense notifications above.
- `ODDISH_CARL_*`, `ODDISH_API_KEY`, and `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL_RO` extend that same Slack app with read-only answers to permitted `app_mention` events. Carl keeps the existing `/webhooks/slack/events` URL and `link_shared` subscription; add `app_mentions:read` and subscribe the installed app to `app_mention`. The SQL DSN must use a dedicated non-superuser role restricted to the analytics table allow-list. See `slackbot/README.md`.

### Observability (Pydantic Logfire)

Optional. Provision a write token in Logfire and add it to the
`oddish-prod` Modal secret so the API containers and workers both
pick it up:

- `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` — Logfire write token (the only required value).
- `LOGFIRE_ENVIRONMENT` *(optional)* — overrides the auto-detected
  label (`production` / `preview` / `development`). PR previews on
  Modal are auto-tagged `preview` and ride with `oddish.pr=<number>`
  as a span attribute, so you can filter `deployment.environment ==
  "preview"` across all PRs and drill into one with `oddish.pr`.
- `LOGFIRE_SERVICE_NAME` *(optional)* — defaults to `oddish-backend`.
- `ODDISH_LOGFIRE_INSTRUMENT_SQLA` *(optional, default `0`)* — set to
  `1` to also wrap SQLAlchemy executes with span instrumentation. We
  already wrap asyncpg one layer down, and the SQLA wrapper walks
  every statement's expression tree, which is meaningful overhead on
  hot paths.

Modal runtime knobs are read directly by `modal_app.py`, which is the source
of truth for the full list and defaults. They cover worker enablement
(`ODDISH_ENABLE_MODAL_WORKERS`, `ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS`),
API/worker/dispatcher/reconciler container
scaling and CPU/memory sizing (`ODDISH_MODAL_API_*`, `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_*`,
`ODDISH_MODAL_DISPATCHER_*`, `ODDISH_MODAL_RECONCILER_*`), schedule intervals
and timeouts (`ODDISH_MODAL_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
`ODDISH_MODAL_CLEANUP_*_SECONDS`, `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`),
throughput (`ODDISH_MODAL_MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL`, default `256`;
`ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS`, default `2688`), per-model concurrency
(`ODDISH_DEFAULT_MODEL_CONCURRENCY`, `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES`,
`ODDISH_MODAL_NOP_ORACLE_CONCURRENCY`), and app naming (`MODAL_APP_NAME`,
`MODAL_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT`).

Local `backend/.env` values are layered on top of the shared Modal secret for local deploys.

### Ephemeral EC2 Harbor backend

EC2 is an explicit CPU-only provider; Daytona remains the default. Set the
non-secret `ODDISH_EC2_*` launch coordinates from `backend/.env.example` and
name two dedicated Modal secrets:

- The control secret contains `ODDISH_EC2_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
  `ODDISH_EC2_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and optional
  `ODDISH_EC2_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.
- The worker-only SSH secret contains `ODDISH_EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.

Only dedicated `ec2_trial` worker functions receive both secrets. Generic trial
workers receive neither; the reconciler and dedicated `teardown_ec2_sandbox`
function receive only control credentials. API and dispatcher functions receive
neither. API cancellation delegates one teardown call to that dedicated
function. EC2 workers materialize the AWS credentials and SSH key as mode-`0600`
temporary files, pass only the named AWS profile and key path to Harbor, and
remove the raw secret variables from the Harbor child. Set
`ODDISH_EC2_MAX_CONCURRENT_INSTANCES` to the provider-wide instance cap; this is
enforced across every model and Harbor variant. The dispatcher subtracts live
EC2 leases before spending its per-poll spawn budget, and workers retain the
atomic lease-acquisition check before claiming a trial.
The control policy must include `sts:GetCallerIdentity` in addition to the EC2
launch, describe, image lookup, tag, and terminate actions listed in
`.env.example`.

Standalone hosts installed with `oddish[worker]` must also provide the OpenSSH
client (`openssh-client` on Debian/Ubuntu), because Harbor invokes `ssh` to reach
the VM. The shared `backend/Dockerfile` already installs this package for the
Railway/Docker deployment path, and the Modal worker image installs it as well.

### oddish runtime patching

`endpoints.py`, `serve.py`, and `worker/runtime.py` patch oddish settings at startup:

- `endpoints.py` / `serve.py`: set `db_use_null_pool` for per-request DB connections
- `worker/runtime.py`: refresh DB connection pools per container, ensure the per-container Harbor scratch dir exists (defaults to `/tmp/harbor-jobs`), and force Harbor environment to Modal-compatible mode

## API Endpoints

All routes require auth unless marked public.

## Database and Migrations

Two migration stacks are required on fresh environments:
1. Core tables: `oddish/alembic/`
2. Cloud tables/extensions: `backend/alembic/`

```bash
# Core (run in oddish/)
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Cloud (run in backend/)
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Apply migrations against the database in `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL` (for example a hosted Postgres instance).

## Development Workflows

```bash
# Install backend deps (includes the local ../oddish path dependency)
cd backend
uv sync
```

```bash
# Backend only (Modal local serve)
cd backend
uv run modal serve deploy.py
```

For full-stack local development, run the Modal backend and point the frontend at it:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
cd backend
uv run modal serve deploy.py

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `frontend/.env.local` to the `modal serve` URL
(printed by Terminal 1, e.g. `https://<workspace>--api-dev.modal.run`). See
`frontend/env.example` for the full frontend env surface, and
[`../SELF_HOSTING.md`](../SELF_HOSTING.md) for the HTTPS / production-Clerk
variant of this loop.

### Smoke tests

```bash
# authenticated list
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ODDISH_API_KEY" "$ODDISH_API_URL/tasks" | jq

# dashboard queue overview
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ODDISH_API_KEY" "$ODDISH_API_URL/dashboard" | jq '.queues'
```

## User quotas — enforcement rollout (`ODDISH_QUOTA_MODE`)

Per-user dollar budgets use a rolling 24-hour window. Spend counts until 24h
after the trial finished. Caps count trial inference spend only unless
`ODDISH_QUOTA_COUNTS_ANALYSIS_AND_COMPUTE=1`, which additionally folds
analyzer/QA (`analysis_costs`) and sandbox compute (`modal_costs`) into both
windows; it is off by default because turning it on lowers every payer's
headroom at once. The operator toggle is `ODDISH_QUOTA_MODE` (`enforce` by
default; `shadow` observes without blocking). Each stage is a config flip, no
redeploy of code (`off` stays available as a full no-op opt-out):

1. **`shadow`** — compute the check and emit a structured
   `quota.would_block` event (`metric=quota.would_block reason=… org_id=…
   billed_user_id=… used=… limit=…`) but never raise. Scrape those logs to
   enumerate who *would* be blocked and which submissions have an unresolved
   payer (`billed_user_id` None — an unlinked GitHub author); notify those users
   to link at oddish.app. `billed_user_id` is stamped at trial creation, so the
   usage data accrues before any enforcement.
2. **`enforce`** (default) — over-budget submissions get HTTP **402** with
   `{"detail": {message, used_usd, reserved_usd, limit_usd}}`; an
   unattributable run gets **403**.

An unattributable run is *retried* rather than submitted fresh (`POST
/trials/{id}/retry`) it cannot 403 — there is no payer to bill and refusing
would strand the run. That spend instead pools per org, logged as
`metric=quota.admitted reason=unattributed_admitted`. Set
`ODDISH_UNATTRIBUTED_POOL_LIMIT_USD` to cap that pool over the rolling 24h
(unset = uncapped). Cap it deliberately: the pool drains only by aging, since a
retry copies the NULL payer and re-enters it, and **no per-user override can
raise it** — the fix for a full pool is repairing attribution.

There is **no seed/coverage pre-step**: stamping is already live from the
attribution slice, and a member with no `quotas` override row is enforced at
`ODDISH_DEFAULT_DAILY_QUOTA_USD` (default-at-read). When `quota_mode != off`, the
API startup verifies `trials.billed_user_id` and the `quotas` + `quota_bumps` +
`org_quotas` tables exist. Under `enforce` a missing object **fails startup**,
naming what is absent: `oddish/` and `backend/` migrate on separate alembic
trees, so deploy-before-migrate is a real window, and serving every request
uncapped is worse than being down. Set
`ODDISH_ALLOW_QUOTA_SCHEMA_DEGRADE=1` to opt into the older behaviour (log and
force `off`) instead. Under `shadow` it always degrades rather than failing —
nothing is relying on enforcement. Tune `ODDISH_DEFAULT_DAILY_QUOTA_USD` and
`ODDISH_PENDING_TRIAL_RESERVATION_USD` without a code change.

Oddish pauses live Harbor jobs before the hard cap. The default reserve is 5%
of the effective user or organization quota; set
`ODDISH_QUOTA_PAUSE_REMAINING_PERCENT=0` to disable it. An optional
`ODDISH_QUOTA_PAUSE_REMAINING_USD` reserve can be used instead or alongside it;
when both are set, the larger reserve wins. The soft check counts settled spend
plus cost already reported by running trials, while the existing hard cap
remains the cancellation backstop. A paused trial stays `RUNNING`, keeps its
queue slot and heartbeat, and resumes after rolling spend expires or its quota
is raised.

**Temporary quota bumps.** `POST /quotas/{user_id}/bumps` grants `+amount_usd`
for `duration_hours`, with expiry computed on the DB clock (immune to client
clock skew); `DELETE /quotas/{user_id}/bumps` revokes a member's live
bumps by stamping `revoked_at` (audit rows survive). Effective limit is
`base + SUM(live bumps)` where live means `revoked_at IS NULL`, `deleted_at IS
NULL`, and `expires_at > NOW()` (read-time expiry on the DB clock — no scheduler
or revert job). After a bump expires the member's spend still counts in the
rolling window, so they may block at the base limit — that is intended.

### Org-wide monthly cap

Layered on top of the per-user rolling window is an **org-wide aggregate
CALENDAR-MONTH (UTC) cap**: the sum of *all* payers' settled spend in an org
(including unattributed NULL-billed spend) plus its in-flight reservation. It
resets on the 1st (UTC) to match billing periods. It ships **inert** —
`ODDISH_DEFAULT_ORG_MONTHLY_QUOTA_USD` is unset (`None` = no org cap) and no
`org_quotas` override rows exist, so the org check short-circuits until a cap is
configured. Enable per-org via `PUT /quotas/org` (admin, `require_can_manage_quotas`)
or globally via the env default. Under `enforce`, an over-cap submission gets
HTTP **402** (`"Your organization is over its monthly budget …"`); under
`shadow` it emits `metric=quota.would_block reason=org_over_budget`. Admins see
month-to-date org usage on `GET /quotas`; any member can read the org budget
snapshot + adaptive daily goal on `GET /quotas/org`. Admission takes no
locks; concurrent submissions can briefly overshoot a cap and the
enforcement sweep cancels the overage. Only the sweep takes the quota
advisory locks (org → payer, non-blocking).
