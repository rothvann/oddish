# Oddish Repository Guide

This file is the technical guide for the entire monorepo. End-user CLI docs live in `DOCS.md`.

The repo has three main packages:

- `oddish/` — the core Python CLI, FastAPI server, queueing layer, and worker runtime
- `backend/` — the hosted cloud layer built on top of `oddish`; adds multi-tenant auth, Modal deployment, and product-specific endpoints
- `frontend/` — the Next.js App Router dashboard and public pages

Python `3.13` is required for `oddish` and `backend`. Node.js `20+` and `pnpm` are required for `frontend`.

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep `DOCS.md` focused on end-user CLI workflows; keep `oddish/README.md` as a short package quick start.
- Put `oddish` implementation details, architecture notes, and local development guidance here.
- If you change the CLI surface in `oddish/src/oddish/cli/`, update `DOCS.md` and the command list in `oddish/README.md`.
- If you change API contracts, queue behavior, or storage layout, update this file.
- If you change `backend/` auth, deployment, or worker orchestration, update this file.
- If you change `frontend/` routing, API proxy structure, or auth behavior, update this file.
- Preserve the package boundary: `oddish/` must remain self-hostable for the
  CLI and standalone server; hosted product concerns (auth, org membership,
  Modal app wiring, managed worker spawning, GitHub/webhook integrations, and
  cloud-only policy) belong in `backend/`.

```

High-level flow:

1. Upload a task bundle directly to S3 via a presigned PUT URL.
2. Submit a sweep of agent/model trials for that task; each trial is
   enqueued as a `worker_jobs` row in the same transaction as its domain
   row. Set `max_trial_attempts` on a sweep submission or sweep config to
   override the total attempt budget for newly-created trials. Re-submitting
   the same task-version/experiment sweep reconciles to the requested count:
   live non-failed trials are retained, while failed slots get fresh trial
   rows and the old attempts point to those replacements through
   `superseded_by_trial_id`. This preserves retry history without leaving the
   failed attempts in normal UI/API trial sets.
3. Workers claim one `worker_jobs` row at a time, dispatch to the registered
   handler for its kind, write heartbeats, and exit.
4. Scoped QA assignments enqueue independent `ANALYZER_BLOCK` jobs through
   `oddish.core.qa_assignments.enqueue_qa_assignment_runs_core`. `pre_trial`
   fires once per assignment and task version during sweep submission;
   `post_trial` fires once per assignment and final terminal trial. The
   `(qa_assignment_id, stage_event_key)` partial unique index makes lifecycle
   retries idempotent. These jobs are additive and non-blocking: their failure
   does not change trial state or the built-in task verdict pipeline. API
   assignments are prompt-only; sandbox assignments may request an
   authenticated short-lived Oddish CLI.
5. Trajectory analysis is **task-scoped**: when every trial of a
   `run_analysis` task is terminal, a single `QA` job is enqueued. That one
   job classifies every live trial's trajectory (written to `trials.analysis`)
   and then synthesizes the task verdict (`tasks.verdict`). A sweep of `T`
   tasks × `N` trials therefore enqueues `T` QA jobs, not `T × (N + 1)`.
6. While a trial runs, a worker-side tailer (`oddish.workers.harbor.live_tail`,
   on by default via `live_tail_enabled` / `live_tail_interval_sec`) polls the
   agent's log file inside the sandbox for supported agents (claude-code,
   codex, cursor-cli, mini-swe-agent), folds token usage, checkpoints live
   tokens/cost onto the trial row (`UPDATE … WHERE finished_at IS NULL`, so
   inflight quota reservations only tighten), and appends transcript events to
   `trial_events` (PK `(trial_id, attempt, seq)`, capped at 5000 events).
   `GET /trials/{id}/live` serves them with an `(attempt, after_seq)` cursor to
   `oddish logs [--follow]` and the dashboard Live tab. Events are purged when
   the trial goes terminal (S3 stays the permanent record); a 24h TTL sweep in
   the cleanup pass reaps rows leaked by hard-killed workers. A RETRYING trial
   clears `finished_at` and keeps its cost monotonic so it still counts as
   inflight for quotas and `/live`. Claude assistant deltas and tool blocks carry
   a hashed `turn_id` in their event payload so clients can distinguish streamed
   suffixes from a new no-tool assistant turn without exposing provider message
   identifiers. Claude message payloads also carry a `block_index` and
   `text_mode` (`append` or `replace`) so clients can assemble corrected text
   snapshots without concatenating stale content.
   Each persisted cost checkpoint re-evaluates enforced quotas. Reaching a
   payer's rolling-24h cap cancels every quota-counted nonterminal trial billed
   to that payer; reaching the org's monthly cap cancels every quota-counted
   nonterminal trial in the org. Final result settlement performs the same
   check for agents without live usage. Cancellation retires queued, running,
   blocked, and retrying worker jobs in the database before terminating remote
   handles; a task is failed only when no other live trial remains.
7. Trial completion persists queryable execution metrics on the trial row:
   input/cache/output tokens, total trajectory steps, native runtime cost when
   reported, phase timing, trajectory availability, arbitrary verifier
   `metrics.json`, and a compact `_verifier` summary when the verifier emits a
   Common Test Report Format `verifier/ctrf.json`. The full CTRF report stays in
   S3; only counts, the tool name, and the report's trial-relative artifact path
   are stored in `trials.result`. Use the CLI or dashboard to watch progress and
   pull logs/artifacts back locally.
   It also derives trajectory elapsed time and tool usage directly from ATIF
   steps into `trials.trajectory_duration_seconds`, `trials.total_tool_calls`,
   and `trials.tool_counts`. Task and experiment filters combine model and
   trajectory metric constraints against the same eligible trial. Their
   `any` mode requires one passing trial; `all` requires at least one eligible
   trial and rejects the row when any eligible trial fails the constraints.
   The canonical cross-surface contract is `oddish.filters.TrialMetricFilter`;
   CLI and API adapters must parse/serialize through it. SQL surfaces must use
   `oddish.filters.trial_predicates.build_trial_metric_predicate` with an
   injected `EligibleTrialScope` rather than reimplementing Any/All logic.

Trajectory summaries use schema v5. Each taxonomy-valued `components` entry
contains its `step_ids`, summary, and deterministic `tool_count` and
`duration_ms` metadata. Step count is the length of `step_ids`; the other
analytics are computed from the immutable
trajectory after LLM parsing (not generated by the model). Component duration is
the sum of each included step's elapsed time since the preceding trajectory
step; the first step and steps without two usable timestamps contribute zero.
The frontend derives the same values for older summaries that lack the fields.

QA analyzer prompts are stored in the versioned `prompts` / `prompt_versions`
registry. `PromptKind.QA_PRE_TRIAL` drives the source audit,
`PromptKind.QA_POST_TRIAL` drives the existing per-trial log classifier, and
`PromptKind.TRAJECTORY_SUMMARY` drives schema-v5 trajectory summaries; its
template must retain the `{{taxonomy}}` placeholder rendered by the block.
Prompt updates append immutable versions and the highest version always runs. Workers
seed missing built-in kinds at startup without overwriting operator edits. A
trial classification records the post-trial prompt kind and version in
`trials.analysis`; local/library classification without a registry row falls
back to the packaged `analyze/classify_prompt.txt`.

Hosted prompt overrides may be scoped to an org, user, experiment, task, or
trial. Resolution is trial → task → experiment → user → org → global, and every
domain-scoped read must first verify that the target belongs to the active org.
Scoped prompt identity includes `org_id`; in particular, the same user may have
independent overrides for the same kind in multiple organizations.

### Worker job kinds

`WorkerJobKind` (in `oddish.db.models`):

- **Active**: `TRIAL` (Harbor trial execution), `QA` (task-level classify-all-trials +
  verdict), `ANALYZER` (cross-experiment report orchestration),
  `ANALYZER_BLOCK` (one declarative `analyzer_runs` execution),
  `TASK_EXPAND` (sweep expansion), `TAG_PROJECT` (tag recompute).
- **Legacy, drain-only**: `ANALYSIS` (per-trial classification; `AnalysisJobHandler`
  is kept only so in-flight rows survive a deploy) and `VERDICT` (enum value only,
  no handler). Nothing enqueues either anymore.
- **Reserved**: `QA_REVIEW` (enum value, no handler yet).

### Custom QA runs

`POST /qa/runs` (hosted backend) creates one `analyzer_runs` row and one
`ANALYZER_BLOCK` worker job per registered prompt variant, then returns the
queued runs. `GET /qa/runs/{id}` and the `/prompts` endpoints expose durable
lineage. The shared `prompts` registry is kind-addressed — built-in UPPERCASE
kinds (`QA_PRE_TRIAL`, `QA_POST_TRIAL`) plus lowercase-slug custom kinds for
saved QA variants — `prompt_versions` stores immutable numbered content, and
`analyzer_runs` records the exact version, scope (`experiment` / `task` /
`trial`), model, reasoning effort, backend, resolved config/command,
`analyzer_blocks` ID, status, and output. Every prompt edit appends an
immutable version and the highest version is always the one that runs (no
activation pointer).

`oddish prompt` manages registry versions. `oddish qa ... --variant KIND` uses
the latest version and `--variant KIND@N` pins a historical version. Variants in
one request run concurrently for A/B comparison. The hosted `sandbox` backend
installs the Oddish CLI only with explicit `--allow-oddish-cli`. At worker
execution time its client factory mints a short-lived internal TASKS-scoped
key and revokes it during cleanup; the caller's credential is never forwarded
or persisted. The `api` backend is prompt-only and rejects CLI access.

## Package Boundaries

`oddish` owns the execution core and shared queue/runtime primitives:

- core models and migrations, including `worker_jobs` and `queue_slots`
- unified claim/dispatch SQL, one `run_single_worker_job` runner, and a
  handler registry (`TrialJobHandler`, `QaJobHandler`, `TaskExpandJobHandler`,
  `TagProjectJobHandler`, plus the legacy `AnalysisJobHandler`)
- the task-level QA job (`run_task_qa_job`): classify every live trial via
  the shared `classify_trial_and_store`, then synthesize the task verdict
- post-trial classification runs through `AnalyzerBlock`. It reads two
  already-downloaded directories and executes nothing, so `resolve_substrate`
  keeps it on the worker-local Claude Code client (`CLAUDE_CLI`) everywhere;
  `post_trial_sandbox_enabled` is the operator opt-in that lifts it into a
  Daytona `SANDBOX`, which restores the task/trial snapshot at the worker's own
  absolute paths so no prompt rewriting is involved. Its costs use the
  `post_trial` job kind; the legacy `trial_classifier` cost bucket is retired at
  this cutover, and every block row carries `block_metadata.cost_status`
  (`recorded` | `no_usage` | `failed`) so lost spend is queryable.
- shared queue-slot leasing, per-queue-key concurrency limits, and
  per-user fairness on `TRIAL` claims
- database-backed admin concurrency overrides; these take precedence over
  `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES` and are read by both the dispatcher plan
  and each worker's slot acquisition. This is the supported way to change a
  per-model limit at runtime. The self-tuning advisory controller
  (`ODDISH_DYNAMIC_MODEL_CONCURRENCY` + `concurrency_controller.py`) is
  **deprecated** in favor of it: leave the flag OFF; enabling it logs a
  deprecation warning and the path may be removed
- stale-heartbeat reaping, RETRYING → QUEUED mirror-back, and pipeline
  stage reconciliation in one cleanup sweep
- soft-delete semantics on domain rows via the `deleted_at` column and
  a session-level filter (`oddish.db.soft_delete`)

`oddish/src/oddish/blocks/` holds the analyzer-block primitive (prompt
building, streaming, `analyzer_blocks` + S3 persistence) and its API/OpenAI
backends, so verdict synthesis runs in a backend-free worker. The Daytona
sandbox backend needs cc_chat and stays in
`backend/api/services/blocks/analyzer/sandbox_llm_client.py`, which registers
itself into core's client factory on import. `AnalyzerBlock` owns a
self-provisioned client's complete lifecycle, including sandbox file downloads
before close. Hosted callers request sandbox capabilities declaratively; the
registered Daytona factory owns runtime/CLI installation, short-lived internal
key minting, and key/sandbox cleanup. Callers must not provision and inject a
one-off sandbox client for those capabilities.

Hosted failure analysis uses
`backend/api/services/cc_chat/analyzer_block_runner.py`: it partitions a bucket
into map batches, runs independent sandbox-backed `AnalyzerBlock`s concurrently
up to `AnalyzerEvalConfig.map_concurrency`, collects their findings artifacts
host-side, and supplies those artifacts declaratively to a separate reduce
block. Map/reduce blocks never share or receive a live runtime/client.

`oddish` must not import from `backend/`, `backend.auth`, `backend.models`,
`cloud_policy`, `idempotency_store`, Clerk, or Modal app/deployment modules.
Keep optional provider/runtime SDK imports lazy behind core abstractions so a
CLI/self-host install can run without hosted deployment dependencies. If shared
behavior is needed by both products, put the host-agnostic primitive under
`oddish/src/oddish/core`, `oddish/src/oddish/workers`, or another neutral
`oddish` module, then wrap it from `backend/`.

`backend` wraps `oddish` with the hosted-only layer: Clerk/API key auth,
org-scoped APIs, Modal worker spawning and runtime patching, cloud environment
policy, GitHub notification hooks, and public sharing / product endpoints.

`frontend` provides the user-facing layer: the authenticated dashboard,
Clerk-based auth and org management, and Next.js route handlers that proxy
requests to the backend.

The hosted `/admin` dashboard is tenant-scoped even though its core diagnostic
helpers also serve the global self-hosted/operator view. Ordinary hosted queue
status, queue health, worker, orphan, cost, per-user cost, and task-expansion
handlers must pass `auth.org_id`; never accept an organization selector from
the client. A user cost drilldown returns 404 when the requested user belongs
to another org. Deployment-wide diagnostics or mutations (global queue
status/health and slot topology, model concurrency, shared-channel Slack alert
settings, and the global cost-excluded LLM-key list) additionally require the active org to match
`ODDISH_OPERATOR_ORG_ID`, which fails closed when unset; the frontend discovers
that capability through `GET /admin/operator-access` and hides those controls
for other orgs.

The authenticated org-scoped cost leaderboard is served by `GET /leaderboard` in
`backend/api/routers/dashboard.py`. It shares the admin cost dashboard's
settled first-party spend basis and must stay in sync with its per-user rows:
every spend bucket except Unattributed ranks, including GitHub-identity buckets
with no registered user (shown by their submitted `@handle`). A registered
person's display name falls back name → `@github_username` → email local part,
so an account with no GitHub link still appears; the full email address must
never be exposed. The response deliberately exposes only a person's spend rank,
display name, and cost. Every query is restricted to the active auth
organization. The frontend `/leaderboard` page and dashboard top-five strip
must not add org, email, model, experiment, trial, or internal-id fields to
that contract. Each row also carries its spend rank so the rare row with no
safe display label (e.g. a payer outside the auth org) drops without
renumbering everyone else.

The admin `GET /admin/costs` response includes analysis spend time series both
by model (`series_qa_by_model`) and by analyzer job kind
(`series_by_analysis_type`). The Cost breakdown chart exposes the latter as the
`Analyzer` stack; analyzer spend does not belong on the people leaderboard.

### Task Identity

`tasks.name` is the human-readable lookup key within an org. Live task names
must stay unique and indexed (`idx_tasks_unique_org_name`) so an upload of the
same task name resolves to the existing task and creates a new `task_versions`
row instead of creating a different task. Renaming a task is allowed, but any
rename path must preserve the live `(org_id, name)` uniqueness invariant and
must not split the task's version history.

`TaskStatusResponse.current_version` / `current_version_id` always report the
task's selected default (`tasks.current_version_id`), including on experiment
pages. Experiment endpoints may scope their trials and aggregate counts to an
experiment-relevant historical version so old or gathered runs remain visible,
but that trial-selection pivot must not replace the reported task default. They
report the pivot separately as `trial_version` / `trial_version_id`, including
on lightweight task shells that omit trial rows.

`tasks.current_version_id` is the user-selectable default, not necessarily the
numerically latest version. In an experiment view, `trial_version_id` uses that
default when the experiment has a non-superseded, non-probe trial for it;
otherwise it falls back to the highest version represented by such trials. The
`task-shells` and `slim-tasks` endpoints must apply the same trial-version rule
so progressive loading cannot change the files/counts pivot or mix one
version's trials with another's artifacts.

Sweep appends resolve their own version through `resolve_append_version_id`
(`oddish/core/endpoints/sweep.py`). A submission whose `content_hash` is `None`
uploaded no task directory, so it pins new trials -- and scopes its
failed-trial reconciliation -- to the target experiment's effective version
rather than `tasks.current_version_id`. This keeps a top-up on the version the
experiment grid already displays instead of pivoting the whole row onto a
default that an unrelated run advanced. Submissions that carry content, target
no experiment, or name an experiment with no trials for the task keep the task
default. `create_task` is unaffected: a fresh task always runs its own upload.

`GET /experiments/{experiment_id}/cost-totals` reports both cost and token
usage across every trial owned by the experiment, including older versions,
superseded retries, probes, and soft-deleted trials. Its `billed_*` cost and
token fields are the billed-user subset used by the frontend's New spend tile.

## `oddish/` — Core Package

### Install Extras

The base `pip install oddish` is CLI-only (light deps). Use extras for server and worker use cases:

```bash
pip install oddish            # CLI only — typer, httpx, pydantic, harbor
pip install oddish[server]    # + FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, alembic, aioboto3
pip install oddish[worker]    # + server + LLM provider SDKs
pip install oddish[all]       # everything including dev tools
```

### Entry Points

- CLI: `oddish` → `oddish.cli:app`
- API server: `python -m oddish.server` (requires `oddish[server]`)
- Standalone worker: `python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker` (requires `oddish[worker]`)
- DB helper CLI: `python -m oddish.db` (requires `oddish[server]`)
- Doc-store MCP server: `oddish-docstore-mcp` (see `oddish/src/oddish/mcp/README.md`)
- Queue key backfill (one-off ops tool): `python -m oddish.backfill_queue_keys`

### Soft Delete

Every model that mixes in `TimestampedMixin` has a `deleted_at` column, but
only classes registered through `oddish.db.soft_delete.register_soft_delete_models`
participate in the session-level auto-filter:

| Package | Soft-deletable models |
|---------|------------------------|
| `oddish.db.models` | `ExperimentModel`, `TaskModel`, `TrialModel`, `TagModel`, `TagAssignmentModel`, `TagExclusionModel`, `TagGrantModel`, `SavedTagFilterModel`, `SkillModel`, `DocumentModel` |
| `backend.models` | `OrganizationModel`, `UserModel`, `APIKeyModel` |

Behavior:

- ORM `SELECT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` issued through a session pick up
  `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` automatically, including eager-loaded
  relationships and aliased subqueries.
- The deletion helpers in `oddish.core.endpoints.deletion` (`delete_task_core`,
  `delete_experiment_core`, `delete_trial_core`) tombstone rows via
  `UPDATE ... SET deleted_at = NOW()` and cancel any matching `worker_jobs`
  rows. They return an empty `s3_prefixes` list so caller S3 cleanup is a
  no-op — S3 data is preserved for restore.
- `unlink_task_from_experiment_core` (same module) is the *scoped* sibling:
  it tombstones only the `task_experiments` join row for one
  `(task_id, experiment_id)` pair plus that experiment's trials for the task,
  and **never** the task row — so a *shared* task can be pulled out of one
  experiment without disturbing the others. It also fires the
  membership-removed tag hook so inherited EXPERIMENT tags drop.
- The `task_experiments` join table also carries `deleted_at`. Because it is a
  SQLAlchemy `Table`, not a registered model, live membership queries and
  relationship joins must explicitly include `task_experiments.deleted_at IS NULL`.
- Raw `text()` SQL doesn't run through the ORM listener; the dispatcher claim
  path (`worker_job_single_job.py`), cleanup sweep, and admin diagnostics each
  add `deleted_at IS NULL` inline.
- The `(org_id, name)` uniqueness on `tasks` is a **partial** unique index
  (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`) so a deleted task's name slot is reusable.
- To read or rewrite tombstoned rows, opt out per statement:
  `session.execute(stmt.execution_options(include_deleted=True))`.

### Worker Runtime (`oddish.workers.queue`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `worker_job_dispatcher.py` | `discover_active_worker_job_queue_keys`, `get_worker_job_org_queue_counts`, `build_spawn_plan` (org-first fair-share, with within-org round-robin across queue_keys) |
| `worker_job_single_job.py` | `_CLAIM_WORKER_JOB_SQL`, `run_single_worker_job`, `heartbeat_worker_job` |
| `trial_handler.py` | TRIAL execution body |
| `qa_handler.py` | Task-level QA job: `run_task_qa_job` classifies every live trial then synthesizes the verdict |
| `analysis_handler.py` | `classify_trial_and_store` (shared per-trial classifier) + the transitional `run_analysis_job` wrapper for in-flight legacy ANALYSIS rows |
| `task_expand_handler.py` / `tag_project_handler.py` | TASK_EXPAND and TAG_PROJECT job bodies |
| `cleanup.py` | Zombie reaper, stale-heartbeat sweep, stage safety nets, **per-slot** orphaned-slot release (see invariants below) |
| `slots.py` | `queue_slots` lease acquire/release (`locked_by` / `locked_until` / `locked_at`) |
| `queue_manager.py` | Per-queue-key concurrency bookkeeping, `run_polling_worker` |
| `worker.py` | Standalone poll loop (`python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker`) |

Auxiliary modules (`concurrency_controller.py` (deprecated — see admin
overrides), `db_helpers.py`, `job_tokens.py`, `runtime_status.py`, `shared.py`,
`trial_failures.py`) support these.

Handler registration lives in `oddish.workers.jobs` (`registry.py`,
`handlers.py`). Both the standalone worker and the backend call
`ensure_builtin_handlers_registered()` at startup.

### Local Development

You need a running Postgres instance. Start one however you prefer (e.g.
`docker run -d --name oddish-db -e POSTGRES_USER=oddish -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=oddish -e POSTGRES_DB=oddish -p 5432:5432 postgres:16-alpine`),
then:

```bash
cd oddish
cp env.example .env
uv sync --extra server
uv run python -m oddish.db setup
uv run python -m oddish.server
```

That gives you the API on `http://localhost:8000` with background workers
started by the API process. Point the CLI at it with
`export ODDISH_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"`. For the hosted Oddish API
instead, keep the default API URL and set `ODDISH_API_KEY="ok_..."`.

`python -m oddish.server` auto-starts workers by default. For separate worker
processes (scaling or debugging): `uv run python -m oddish.workers.queue.worker`.

### Database Commands

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.db init    # run Alembic migrations
uv run python -m oddish.db setup   # alias for init
uv run python -m oddish.db reset   # drop and recreate all tables
uv run python -m oddish.db purge   # delete data, preserve migration state
```

### API Server Flags

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
uv run python -m oddish.server --n-concurrent '{"openai/gpt-5.2": 8, "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5": 8}'
```

### HTTP Endpoints (core standalone server)

Routes registered in `oddish/src/oddish/server/__init__.py`. The hosted backend
exposes a superset (org-scoped, plus documents/tags/skills/orgs/api-keys/admin
extensions) — see `backend/README.md`.

| Area | Endpoints |
|------|-----------|
| Health / dashboard | `GET /health`, `GET /dashboard` |
| Task upload | `POST /tasks/upload/init` (returns presigned PUT URL), `POST /tasks/upload/complete` |
| Trial import | `POST /trials/import/init`, `POST /trials/import/complete` |
| Sweeps | `POST /tasks/sweep`, `POST /tasks/sweep/batch` |
| Tasks | `GET /tasks`, `GET /tasks/browse`, `GET /tasks/{task_id}`, `GET /tasks/{task_id}/detail`, `GET /tasks/{task_id}/versions[/{version}]`, `PUT /tasks/{task_id}/versions/{version}/default`, `POST /tasks/cancel` |
| Task QA | `POST /tasks/{task_id}/qa/retry`, `POST /tasks/{task_id}/qa/cancel`, `POST /tasks/{task_id}/qa/backfill` |
| Experiments | `POST /experiments/combine`, `PATCH /experiments/{experiment_id}` |
| Trials | `GET /tasks/{task_id}/trials/{index}`, `POST /trials/{trial_id}/retry` (optional `registry_auth` body), `GET /trials/{trial_id}/live` ((attempt, seq)-cursor live transcript), `GET /trials/{trial_id}/logs[/structured]`, `GET /trials/{trial_id}/trajectory`, `GET /trials/{trial_id}/result` |
| Files | `GET /tasks/{task_id}/files[/{path}]`, `GET /trials/{trial_id}/files[/{path}]`, `GET /trials/{trial_id}/debug-files` |
| Admin diagnostics | `GET /admin/slots`, `GET /admin/queue-status`, `GET /admin/orphaned-state`, `GET /admin/queue-health` |
| Public sharing | `/public/experiments...` router from `oddish.core.sharing.public` |

The core server has **no DELETE routes**. Deletion endpoints
(`DELETE /experiments/{id}`, `DELETE /experiments/{id}/tasks/{task_id}`,
`DELETE /trials/{trial_id}`) exist only on the hosted backend (admin-gated) and
call the shared `oddish.core.endpoints.deletion` helpers.

Public share links use 256-bit `public_token` values and are access-by-link, not
enumerable. The unauthenticated `/public/experiments` list intentionally returns
no share tokens. Public task/trial/file routes must stay scoped under
`/public/experiments/{public_token}/...` and verify membership in that shared
experiment; do not reintroduce `/public/tasks/{task_id}` or
`/public/trials/{trial_id}` ID-only access. Unpublishing an experiment clears
`public_token`, so republishing mints a fresh link and old URLs stay revoked.

### Configuration and model routing

Settings are loaded from `oddish/.env`; see `oddish/env.example`,
`backend/.env.example`, and `frontend/env.example` for the complete env surface.
Keep these routing rules in sync with `oddish/src/oddish/config.py` and
`oddish/src/oddish/workers/harbor/runner.py`:

- Claude trials run through AWS Bedrock by default. `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` is
  baked into the Modal image, and Claude model aliases must normalize to an
  invokable inference profile (`global.` / `us.` / ARN) via
  `to_bedrock_model_id`. Opt into the direct Anthropic API with a separate key
  via the explicit `anthropic-hdo/<model>` prefix: that route overwrites
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with `ANTHROPIC_HDO_API_KEY` and blanks Bedrock routing
  for the trial.
- OpenAI-family jobs default to Azure OpenAI. Use
  `ODDISH_OPENAI_PROVIDER=openai` plus `OPENAI_API_KEY` only when intentionally
  routing to public OpenAI.
- z.ai, MiniMax, Moonshot/Kimi, Fireworks, xAI, Meta, and Anthropic HDO each
  have explicit canonical provider prefixes and queue keys: `zai/`, `minimax/`,
  `moonshot/`, `fireworks/`, `xai/`, `meta/`, and `anthropic-hdo/`. Add or
  change provider aliases in `config.py`, then update env injection in the
  Harbor runner and the network allowlist notes.
- Provider secrets are referenced by env var name (`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`,
  `ANTHROPIC_HDO_API_KEY`, `ZAI_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`,
  `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `META_API_KEY`) and must not be persisted
  on trial rows.
- `grok-build` (xAI) writes a Grok CLI config whose `[model.*]` blocks pin an
  `api_backend`. Upstream Harbor hardcodes `responses` (`POST /v1/responses`),
  but not every xAI model is served there — some (e.g. newer/unreleased models)
  live only on Chat Completions and answer a Responses request with a 404
  `The model <id> does not exist or your team does not have access to it`.
  `OddishGrokBuild` accepts an `api_backend` kwarg
  (`chat_completions` | `responses` | `messages`); pass
  `--agent-kwarg api_backend=chat_completions` to route such a model. When
  unset, the upstream `responses` default is preserved.
- `grok-build` trajectories come from the CLI's on-disk **session store**, not
  its headless stdout. `grok -p --output-format json|streaming-json` only emits
  the assistant's `text`/`thought` — no tool calls and no token usage — so
  `OddishGrokBuild` copies `$GROK_HOME/sessions/.../<id>/` into
  `/logs/agent/grok-session` after the run and converts `updates.jsonl`
  (ACP `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` / `agent_message_chunk`) plus
  `events.jsonl` usage into the ATIF trajectory + token `FinalMetrics`
  (`grok_build_session.py`). If the session store is missing it falls back to
  the text-only stdout trajectory. Do not "fix" trajectories by parsing stdout —
  the tool calls are only in the session store.
- The grok **live** transcript is the one reader that does parse stdout
  (`GrokBuildFold` in `live_tail.py` tails `/logs/agent/grok-build.json`): the
  session store is copied into the trial logs only after the run, so it cannot
  feed a live view. That panel is therefore text and reasoning only, with no
  tool calls and no running token/cost counters; it is not the trajectory and
  must not be used to build one.

Storage defaults:

- S3-compatible storage is **required**. Clients PUT task bundles directly
  to a presigned URL returned by `/tasks/upload/init` and then call
  `/tasks/upload/complete`.
- uploaded task bundles: `tasks/<task_id>/.oddish-task.tar.gz`
- Harbor job outputs: `/tmp/harbor-jobs`
- Modal workers also check `/mnt/oddish-tasks` before falling back to the S3 download path

## Repo-wide Gotchas

### Never expose probes in public/share views

Probes are an **experimental, internal-only** feature. They must never appear in
any public, unauthenticated surface — the `/share/[token]` experiment view, the
`/datasets/[token]` view, or any `/public/*` API response. Both public views are
fed by the same endpoints in `oddish/src/oddish/core/sharing/public.py`, so the
filtering lives at the **data layer** (don't return `is_probe` trials), not just
the UI:

- `get_public_task` (`sharing/helpers.py`) strips `is_probe` trials from the
  loaded task, covering `get_public_task_status`.
- `list_public_experiment_tasks` excludes `is_probe` when filtering each task's
  trials.
- `list_public_task_trials` always passes `probe=False` (never honors a
  caller-supplied probe filter publicly).

When adding a new public/share endpoint or surfacing a new trial/task field
publicly, exclude probes the same way. Filter at the query/data layer — UI
guards alone are not enough, since the trials still ship to the browser.

### `list_tasks_core` `load_only` and MissingGreenlet

`list_tasks_core` (`oddish/src/oddish/core/endpoints/tasks_query.py`) powers
every `/tasks` route, including the experiment page. Its **compact path**
(`compact_trials=True`) restricts the trial/task/experiment selectin loads with
`load_only(...)`, which makes *only* the enumerated columns eager and defers
everything else. Under async SQLAlchemy, reading a deferred column in a
response builder fires a lazy-load outside the request greenlet and 500s with
`sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet`.

So: whenever you surface a **new `TrialModel` / `TaskModel` / `ExperimentModel`
column in the FE** (i.e. read it in `build_trial_response`,
`build_compact_trial_response`, or `_build_task_status_response` in
`core/helpers.py`), you **must also add that column to the matching `load_only`
set** in `list_tasks_core`. The full (non-compact) builder has no `load_only`,
so it won't catch the omission — the failure only shows up on the compact
experiment page. Builder unit tests can't catch it either (in-memory models
have all attrs set); the bug lives in the query options, not the builder.

### Dashboard pipeline stats use reserved queue keys

`get_queue_stats` / `get_queue_stats_by_org` (`oddish/src/oddish/queue.py`)
bucket trial counts by each trial's own `queue_key`, and the
trajectory-analysis / verdict pipeline counts under the **reserved**
`analysis` / `verdict` buckets (`ANALYSIS_PIPELINE_QUEUE_KEY` /
`VERDICT_PIPELINE_QUEUE_KEY` in `oddish/src/oddish/config.py`). Never key
pipeline counts off the analysis/verdict *model*'s queue key: that folds
pipeline state into a real model's bucket — an incident rendered 4k+ trials
mid-classification as "running workers" under one model's queue while that
model's actual trials were routed into the "analyses" pipeline. These are
presentation buckets only; the task-level QA worker job still enqueues under
`get_qa_queue_key()` (the analysis model's concurrency bucket).

Related invariant: a QA job that dies or is cancelled mid-classification must
not strand its trials in a non-terminal `analysis_status`. The stale-heartbeat
QA mirror resets them (RETRYING → `QUEUED`, FAILED → `FAILED` with the
`ORPHANED_ANALYSIS_ERROR_PREFIX` sentinel), the append-supersede cancel path
requeues in-flight rows via `requeue_inflight_trial_analysis` (which also
reopens sentinel-FAILED rows when an append resurrects the task), and
`_reset_orphaned_trial_analysis` in the cleanup sweep is the backstop. If you
add a new way to kill or cancel a QA job, reset its task's in-flight
`analysis_status` the same way — and select the trial rows `FOR UPDATE SKIP
LOCKED`: these writers may hold the task row lock, and *waiting* on trial rows
inverts the trials-then-task lock order `cancel_tasks_runs` takes (deadlock).

## `backend/` — Hosted Cloud Layer

### Authentication Model

The backend accepts auth from `Authorization`, `X-Clerk-Authorization`, or
`X-Authorization` (parsed in `backend/auth/__init__.py:get_auth_context`;
token verification lives in `backend/auth/verification.py`).

- **API keys** (`ok_...`): stored hashed (SHA-256) in `api_keys`; scopes are `full`, `tasks`, `read`
- **Clerk JWTs**: validated against Clerk JWKS; org context extracted from token claims

There are exactly two org roles: `admin` (manage users/settings) and `member`
(run evals, view results). New users default to `member`.

Auth flow: read token → if `ok_` prefix validate API key → otherwise validate Clerk JWT and resolve org/user → return `AuthContext`.

API key creation is user-auth only (API-key auth is rejected so one key cannot
mint another) and is self-service for every org — any `admin` or `member` user
may create keys for their own org (`can_create_api_keys` /
`require_api_key_creator`). Admins may mint `full`, `tasks`, or `read` keys;
members may mint only `tasks` or `read` keys. Member-created `tasks` keys can
run task/trial workflows and read files, and can cancel in-flight runs, but are
blocked from broader org mutations such
as tagging, collections, documents, skills, and GitHub webhook updates. The
creator role is stamped on the API key at mint time so later role changes or
deleted creator rows do not broaden a member-created key.

If a Clerk JWT arrives without `org_id`, the backend tries to resolve a single existing org membership, or provisions a personal org.

### Worker Architecture

Dispatcher + reconciler + single-job pattern, backed by the unified
`worker_jobs` table. **Dispatch and reconciliation are deliberately separate
scheduled functions** so a slow or deadlocking reconciliation sweep can never
block worker spawning (previously they shared one function under a tight 60s
timeout; a sweep that timed out spawned zero workers that cycle, and a SIGKILL
mid-sweep left orphaned `idle in transaction` locks that deadlocked the next
sweep):

1. `poll_queue()` runs on a `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (180s) Modal schedule under
   `DISPATCHER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (120s). It only discovers active queue keys
   (`discover_active_worker_job_queue_keys`) and launches up to
   `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL` single-job containers via the org-first fair-share
   `build_spawn_plan`. It runs no cleanup. `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL` is the
   dominant throughput ceiling: long agent trials hold a `queue_slots` lease
   for their full duration, so steady-state running workers ≈
   `spawns_per_poll × trial_duration / poll_interval`. It must stay high enough
   to fill the per-model concurrency limits; the per-queue-key slot caps and
   `WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS` remain the real bounds.
2. `reconcile_queue_state()` runs on its own `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (240s)
   schedule under a generous `CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (600s) so it is never
   SIGKILLed mid-transaction. Each phase is wrapped best-effort: stale
   `queue_slots` lease cleanup, `cleanup_orphaned_queue_state` (zombie-txn reap
   + stale-heartbeat sweep + stage safety nets + **per-slot** orphaned slot
   release — see invariants below), and the experiments owner backfill
   (`dashboard_owner_backfill`, which keeps the dashboard Mine filter on its
   indexed fast path). The display-hygiene clear of terminal-trial claim
   metadata (`clear_terminal_trial_runtime_refs`) runs after the main
   transaction commits, in batched `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` transactions, so it
   can neither deadlock against live workers nor roll back the sweep.
3. `process_single_job(queue_key)` acquires a `queue_slots` lease (stamping
   `locked_by = <worker_id>`, `locked_at = NOW()`, `locked_until = NOW() +
   WORKER_TIMEOUT + 30s`) and calls `run_single_worker_job` →
   `drain_worker_jobs`, which atomically claims one or more `worker_jobs` rows
   (stamping `current_worker_id`), dispatches to the registered handler for the
   row's kind, writes heartbeats on both `worker_jobs.heartbeat_at` and the
   mirrored domain column, records the outcome (`SUCCESS` / `RETRYING` /
   `FAILED` / `CANCELLED`), runs the post-success hook when applicable,
   releases the slot in its `finally`, and exits.
4. `send_slack_expense_notifications()` runs every five minutes in production
   when the webhook or the bot token is configured. It deterministically
   alerts for experiments at $1,000 and each additional $1,000 of spend, and
   for any recent trial over $200 -- the old "must exceed 2x the same-task/model
   peer average, with at least one peer" filter (`trial_average_multiplier`)
   is gone, so the $200 floor is unconditional. A trial over $1,000 produces
   two alerts: the owner's DM, plus a separate in-channel escalation
   (`trial-escalation:{id}`) mentioning the owner and the admin-editable
   always-ping list (see below). Both
   carry the ":rotating_light: *Very expensive trial*" heading in place of
   the usual ":warning: *Expensive trial*". Milestones are driven by *new*
   spend: spend that finished within the 2h watch window. Milestones already
   covered by the pre-window baseline (`total - recent`) are claimed and
   completed silently so first observing pre-existing spend never dumps
   historical alerts. Failed loud deliveries retain per-channel retry
   markers; primary and retry completion is atomic. Indeterminate loud claims
   are not repeated because the external channels do not offer an idempotency
   key, while interrupted silent claims are completed without sending.
   The in-channel escalation -- the $1,000 floor a trial must clear to post to
   the shared channel, plus the always-ping list -- is admin-editable at runtime
   from the Costs tab of `/admin`, backed by the single `slack_alert_settings`
   row (`PUT /admin/slack-alert-settings`, `require_admin`). The constants in
   `slack_alert_settings.py` are the defaults that stand when no row exists, and
   DELETE restores them. `load_alerts` reads the row once per run in a session
   of its own -- a missing table (deploy-before-migrate) falls back to the
   defaults rather than aborting the run's transaction. The escalation threshold
   is deliberately absent from the alert key: a key that embedded it would mint
   fresh dedup rows on each retune and re-alert the whole window. The per-user
   DM cutoffs -- the $1,000 milestone/repeat and the $200 trial floor -- are
   deploy-time constants (`DEFAULT_*_USD` in `user_alert_prefs.py`) that each
   person inherits until they override them in their own notification settings;
   they are not admin-editable. The 0.5 experiment-failed ratio stays a module
   constant in `slack_notifications.py` because it governs failure DMs, not
   spend. The five `ODDISH_SLACK_*` threshold env vars
   (`ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSIVE_EXPERIMENT_USD`, `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPERIMENT_REPEAT_USD`,
   `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSIVE_TRIAL_USD`, `ODDISH_SLACK_TRIAL_AVERAGE_MULTIPLIER`,
   `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPERIMENT_FAILED_RATIO`) remain gone. It uses the shared
   settled-cost basis and contains no agent/LLM path. It is on by default for
   the production app and off by default on preview apps; a preview opts in
   by setting `ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS=true` and providing
   either `SLACK_EXPENSE_WEBHOOK_URL` or `SLACK_ALERT_BOT_TOKEN`, optionally
   through a preview-only named secret selected by
   `ODDISH_SLACK_EXPENSE_SECRET_NAME`. The email delivery channel
   (`RESEND_API_KEY`, `ODDISH_EXPENSE_EMAIL_FROM`, `send_owner_emails`,
   `_post_email`) has been deleted entirely.
   Cost alerts -- experiment milestones and expensive trials -- DM their
   experiment's owner; the email channel is gone. The only cost alert that
   still reaches the webhook is the over-$1,000 trial escalation, which
   carries an `<@...>` mention-line prefix resolved from the relevant emails.
   `send_alerts(webhook_url, alerts, *, bot_token=None)` claims each alert
   before resolving its mentions, so already-delivered alerts cost zero Slack
   lookups; a mention-lookup failure never sinks the underlying alert, it
   just posts without the prefix. The DM-only kinds (`dm_only=True`,
   delivered solely by `send_owner_dms`, never posted to the webhook) are
   experiment milestones, expensive trials, experiment-failed, trial-failed,
   and qa-failed. Trial-failed fires for any trial with
   `status == FAILED`, or `status == SUCCESS` with `result->>'harbor_exception'`
   set (a crashed agent still gets its verifier run, so the row lands as
   SUCCESS with an exception marker rather than FAILED); SKIPPED trials never
   match either arm, and soft-deleted, superseded (retried), and
   user-cancelled (`harbor_stage == 'cancelled'`) trials are additionally
   excluded via the existing `current_trial` predicate, gated on
   `finished_at >= recent_cutoff` (the same 2h window). Qa-failed fires for
   `verdict_status == SUCCESS` with `verdict->>'is_good' == 'false'`, or
   `verdict_status == FAILED` with a `verdict_error` other than the
   user-cancellation message `"Cancelled by user"` (cancellation also stamps
   FAILED and is not a QA failure), gated on
   `verdict_finished_at >= recent_cutoff`; its recipient is resolved through
   `TaskModel.created_by_user_id -> UserModel.email`. Both dedup on
   `alert.key` = `"trial-failed:{bucket}"` / `"qa-failed:{bucket}"` where
   `bucket` is the task version id (falling back to the task id on
   unversioned trials); `build_alerts` also collapses duplicate keys produced
   within a single run. The DM claim key is `"dm:{alert.key}:{recipient}"`,
   so each person is DMed at most once per task version, ever.

Handler registration happens at container load via
`ensure_builtin_handlers_registered()`. Post-success hooks
(`notify_github_trial`, `notify_github_qa`, and the transitional
`notify_github_analysis`) are wired through `_POST_SUCCESS_HOOKS` in
`worker/functions.py`. The task-level `QA` job fires `notify_github_qa`,
which refreshes the whole PR comment (per-trial classifications + task
verdict) in one update.

### Worker Runtime Invariants & Pitfalls

Load-bearing properties, several learned from incidents. Changing them naively
silently breaks throughput or correctness — read before touching
`worker/functions.py`, `slots.py`, `cleanup.py`, or the dispatcher.

1. **Workers hold NO DB connection during the Harbor run.** A trial runs for
   minutes to ~12h but only touches the DB for a few ms (claim, 30s heartbeats,
   outcome), so workers use `NullPool` (`Settings.db_use_null_pool`) + per-op
   `asyncpg` connections. ⚠️ Never introduce a pooled/long-lived connection or
   open session spanning the run: it pins one idle connection per running trial
   and exhausts the Supavisor/PgBouncer cap. (The API keeps a warm `QueuePool`
   only because it's short-lived — that reasoning doesn't transfer to workers.)

2. **`queue_slots` is the real concurrency gate.** Per-queue-key concurrency is
   enforced by leasing a `queue_slots` row (`acquire_queue_slot`, `FOR UPDATE
   SKIP LOCKED`), not by spawn count. The dispatcher budgets on `worker_jobs`
   RUNNING (`limit - running`) while the worker gates on a free slot — if those
   counters drift, the dispatcher over-spawns workers that exit immediately
   (watch for `metric=queue_lock_contention` floods).

3. **Slot leases can outlive their worker — reclaim per-slot.** The lease
   (`locked_until`) is `WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS + 30` (~12h); a SIGKILLed /
   preempted worker never runs its `finally` release. `cleanup_orphaned_queue_state`
   frees a slot whenever its `locked_by` has no `RUNNING` `worker_jobs` row on
   `current_worker_id` (with a `locked_at` grace, `ORPHANED_SLOT_GRACE_MINUTES`
   = 2, for the acquire→claim gap). ⚠️ Never gate this per-queue_key (e.g.
   "release only if zero jobs RUNNING on the key") — that was the original bug:
   one live job pinned every leaked lease for ~12h and starved the queue. The
   link is always `queue_slots.locked_by == worker_jobs.current_worker_id`.
   The limit used for both spawn planning and slot acquisition comes from
   `model_concurrency_overrides` when an admin override exists, otherwise from
   the deploy-time `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES` / default settings.
   Dynamic advice never exceeds an admin override, and an override-read failure
   fails closed at zero rather than risking reopening a disabled queue.

4. **One model ⇒ one queue_key.** Limits key off the full `queue_key`; the same
   model under two keys gets the *sum* of both buckets against one provider quota
   (→ 429s, split dashboards, starvation). Canonicalize at enqueue in
   `oddish.config` (`normalize_trial_model` / `get_queue_key_for_trial` /
   `normalize_queue_key`): nop/oracle + variants collapse to the single
   `nop_oracle` id (`is_nop_oracle_agent`); z.ai / MiniMax / Moonshot / xAI map
   to `<provider>/<id>`. ⚠️ Known gap: Gemini isn't canonicalized — a bare
   `gemini-…` becomes `google/…` while `gemini/…` stays `gemini/…`, splitting one
   model across two buckets.

5. **No provider-level concurrency cap.** Each Bedrock/Gemini model id is its own
   bucket, but they share one AWS/Google account quota — the sum of per-model
   limits can exceed account RPM/TPM with no global throttle (a source of 429s).

6. **Stale-heartbeat reap can double-run a trial.** If heartbeats stall for
   `STALE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES` (15, e.g. a pooler blip), the reaper flips the live
   trial to `RETRYING` and another worker may run it concurrently — no fencing
   token. The window is a deliberate trade-off (raised from 10 after an incident);
   shrink with care.

### Local Development

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run modal serve deploy.py
```

### Configuration (backend)

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Minimum required: `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL` and `CLERK_DOMAIN`. Add
`CLERK_SECRET_KEY` for Clerk-backed org management and `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
for webhook ingestion. Common optional settings include `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`,
`CLERK_ISSUER`, `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`, the `ODDISH_S3_*` set, provider keys
(`AZURE_OPENAI_*`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, …),
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `ODDISH_DASHBOARD_URL`. See `backend/.env.example` for the
full surface and `backend/README.md` for details.

Slack link unfurls are a lean hosted-only integration configured through
`ODDISH_SLACK_UNFURL_*`. One manually installed Slack workspace is bound to one
Oddish org; the Slack app needs `links:read` and `links:write`, subscribes to
`link_shared`, and sends signed events to `POST /webhooks/slack/events`.
Optional team and channel allowlists provide defense in depth. This integration
is separate from the scheduled expense-notification webhook.

Hosted API containers keep a conservative warm SQLAlchemy pool by default so
Modal bursts do not overrun shared Postgres poolers. The engine still disables
prepared statement caching so it remains compatible with transaction-mode
poolers such as Supavisor / PgBouncer.

Modal runtime knobs (scaling, schedules, CPU/memory, concurrency) are read
directly by `backend/modal_app.py` from `ODDISH_MODAL_*` /
`ODDISH_DEFAULT_MODEL_CONCURRENCY` / `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_OVERRIDES` /
`ODDISH_ENABLE_SLACK_EXPENSE_NOTIFICATIONS` / `MODAL_APP_NAME` /
`MODAL_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT` env vars. `modal_app.py` is the
source of truth for the full list and defaults (e.g.
`ODDISH_MODAL_MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL=256`,
`ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS=2688`).

### Database Migrations

Two migration stacks are required:

```bash
# Core tables (run in oddish/)
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Cloud tables/extensions (run in backend/)
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

## `frontend/` — Next.js Dashboard

The frontend is a Next.js 16 / React 19 App Router app. Browser code calls
`src/app/api/*` route handlers, which forward to the backend from
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and preserve auth. Public routes are `/`, `/share/*`,
`/datasets/*`, and `/api/public/*`; everything else is Clerk-protected.

The trial drawer surfaces verifier test counts only as a small passed/total
row in the Summary tab (shown on public share views too); trials without test
counts show no row. `_verifier` CTRF counts take precedence, and historical
trials without a persisted `_verifier` summary lazily discover and parse their
`verifier/ctrf.json` artifact through the already-scoped trial files API; do
not add an unscoped artifact lookup for this fallback.

On an experiment page, removing a task always calls the scoped
`DELETE /experiments/{experiment_id}/tasks/{task_id}` proxy. It unlinks that
experiment membership and its scoped trials without deleting the task, even
when it was the task's final experiment membership. Whole-task deletion remains
a separate explicit action outside the experiment-scoped table.

See `frontend/README.md` for route groups, scripts, env vars, and deployment
commands. See `SELF_HOSTING.md` for full-stack local development and production
deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### API does not start

```bash
uv run python -m oddish.db setup
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Pulling from a remote API fails

- Verify `ODDISH_API_URL` and `ODDISH_API_KEY`.
- Try `oddish status` first to confirm auth and connectivity.

### Frontend "Failed to fetch" or disconnected backend

```bash
curl ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:-http://localhost:8000}/openapi.json
```

### Clerk auth issues

- Verify Clerk keys in `frontend/.env.local`.
- If org-scoped backend access fails, confirm `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` is set and includes `org_id`.
- If using production Clerk keys locally, use `frontend/run-prod-clerk-local.sh`.
