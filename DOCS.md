# Oddish CLI

> Harbor-compatible CLI for submitting evals, tracking progress, pulling artifacts, and cleaning up runs.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install "oddish @ git+https://github.com/abundant-ai/oddish.git#subdirectory=oddish"
```

Ensure your API key is set:

```bash
export ODDISH_API_KEY="ok_..."
```

## Usage

**Commands:**

- `oddish run` - submit work, retry failed trials, or re-run task-level QA
- `oddish upload` - register a task or upload existing trials
- `oddish ls` - list uploaded tasks
- `oddish status` - view progress
- `oddish logs` - stream a running trial's live transcript and cost estimate
- `oddish cancel` - stop in-flight task runs or task-level QA jobs
- `oddish backfill-analysis` - (re)run trial analysis for a trial, task, or experiment
- `oddish costs` - view billable-spend accounting (org-wide, or per-user with `--user`)
- `oddish pull` - download logs and artifacts
- `oddish combine` - merge several experiments into a new one
- `oddish collect` - gather trials from tasks/trial IDs into a shareable read-only collection
- `oddish experiment create` - build a collection experiment from explicit trial IDs
- `oddish experiment add` / `oddish experiment remove` / `oddish experiment rename` - edit a collection in place; its share link keeps working
- `oddish delete` - delete task data (trial delete works on hosted Oddish; task/experiment delete is self-host only)
- `oddish publish` / `oddish unpublish` - toggle public read-only sharing for an experiment
- `oddish probe` - internal probe-trial helpers (`oddish probe`, `oddish probe skill add`)

Every command except `oddish logs` accepts `--json` for machine-readable output (CI / scripts / agents).

### Lifecycle

A typical run flows through these commands:

1. `oddish run` (or `oddish upload`) — submit a task, dataset, or sweep and get back a task ID and experiment ID. Task-level QA (per-trial trajectory classification, plus a task verdict when there are enough trials from enough distinct agents) runs automatically once every trial settles.
2. `oddish status` — discover what's in flight, then drill into a specific task or experiment to see trial-level progress and rewards.
3. `oddish pull` — once you have a trial, task, or experiment ID, download its logs, results, trajectories, and artifact files to disk.
4. `oddish run --retry` — re-queue failed trials or re-run task-level QA.
5. `oddish cancel` / `oddish delete` — stop in-flight work or remove data when you're done.
6. `oddish publish` — share an experiment publicly (read-only) and get a link.

`oddish pull` accepts a trial, task, or experiment ID and auto-detects which kind it is; `oddish status` takes a task ID (falling back to experiment lookup) or `--experiment`. `oddish ls` supports the dashboard's task, tag, status, date, model, and trial-metric filters.

## Submit a Job

Use `oddish run` to launch a task, dataset, or multi-agent sweep.

```bash
# Single task
oddish run ./my-task -a claude-code -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5 --n-trials 5

# Append trials to an existing task
oddish run --task <task_id> -a gemini-cli -m google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview

# Complex sweep from config
oddish run ./my-task -c sweep.yaml
```

Re-submitting the same sweep is declarative for each task version and
experiment: queued, running, and successful trials continue to satisfy the
requested count, while failed trials are replaced immutably. The failed rows
remain available by direct ID for history, but are marked superseded so only
their replacements appear in normal task and experiment views.

Options

- `--path`, `-p PATH` - Harbor-compatible path flag for a local task or dataset directory
- `--dataset`, `-d TEXT` - Registry dataset such as `swebench@1.0`
- `--task TEXT` - Append trials to an existing task ID instead of uploading task files
- `--config`, `-c PATH` - YAML or JSON config for multi-agent sweeps
- `--agent`, `-a TEXT` - Agent name for simple single-agent runs (defaults to `claude-code`)
- `--model`, `-m TEXT` - Model override for the selected agent
- `--harbor TEXT` - Override the Harbor source/ref for this run (`main`, a tag/SHA, `org/repo@ref`, or a git URL@ref); defaults to the locked fork commit (env: `ODDISH_HARBOR`)
- `--n-trials INTEGER` - Number of trials per task
- `--max-trial-attempts INTEGER` - Override the maximum Oddish attempts per trial, including the initial run
- `--task-name`, `-t TEXT` - Include task glob filter; can be passed multiple times
- `--exclude-task-name`, `-x TEXT` - Exclude task glob filter; can be passed multiple times
- `--n-tasks`, `-l INTEGER` - Limit the number of selected tasks after filtering
- `--env`, `-e` - Execution environment: `docker`, `daytona`, `ec2`, `e2b`, `modal`, `runloop`, or `gke`. Hosted EC2 is opt-in and must be enabled by the deployment operator; Daytona remains the CPU default.
- `--priority`, `-P TEXT` - Queue priority, typically `low` or `high`
- `--experiment`, `-E TEXT` - Reuse or create an experiment ID/name
- `--user`, `-u TEXT` - Override the author attached to the run. Defaults to the authenticated identity (Clerk-linked email for API keys / dashboard sessions); set this only to attribute a run to someone other than yourself.
- `--github-user`, `-G TEXT` - GitHub user attribution for CI metadata. When omitted, the backend auto-fills this from the authenticated user's Clerk-linked GitHub username (if any) so CI-style attribution still works.
- `--github-meta TEXT` - JSON metadata blob to attach to the task
- `--link TEXT` - Associate URL with the task.
- `--publish/--no-publish` - Publish the experiment for public read-only access (off by default)
- `--watch/--no-watch`, `-w` - Watch progress after submission; enabled by default
- `--background`, `--async`, `-b` - Submit and return immediately
- `--quiet`, `-q` - Suppress startup logs
- `--run-probe` - Auto-enqueue a probe trial for the task version (off by default)
- `--disable-verification/--enable-verification` - Skip task verification or tests
- `--force-new-version` - Allocate a new task version even when the content is unchanged
- `--overwrite-current-version` - Replace the selected current version in place; existing trials pinned to it will resolve to the replacement content
- `--submit-concurrency INTEGER` - Max parallel task uploads/submissions (default: adaptive)
- `--override-cpus INTEGER` - Override environment CPU count
- `--override-memory-mb INTEGER` - Override environment memory
- `--override-gpus INTEGER` - Override environment GPU count
- `--override-storage-mb INTEGER` - Override environment storage
- `--force-build/--no-force-build` - Force a rebuild of the environment image
- `--environment-kwarg`, `--harbor-environment-kwarg TEXT` - Pass Harbor environment kwargs as `KEY=VALUE`; can be used multiple times
- `--ae`, `--agent-env TEXT` - Pass agent env vars as `KEY=VALUE`; can be used multiple times
- `--ak`, `--agent-kwarg TEXT` - Pass agent kwargs as `key=value`; can be used multiple times
- `--allow-agent-host TEXT` - Extra hostname for a restricted agent phase (maps to Harbor `extra_allowed_hosts`); usually unnecessary because Oddish auto-injects the model API host. Can be used multiple times
- `--disable-web-tools/--no-disable-web-tools` - Force-disable server-side web tools; usually unnecessary because Oddish does this automatically on closed-internet agent phases (`claude-code`: `disallowed_tools=WebSearch WebFetch`; `codex`: `web_search=disabled`)
- `--artifact TEXT` - Download an environment path as an artifact after the trial
- `--registry-login TEXT` - Per-run container-registry login as `username=USER,token=TOKEN[,registry=docker.io]`; repeatable and honored by `--retry`.
  Wrap comma-bearing values like `--registry-login "username=USER,token='a,b'"`.
  Credentials authenticate sandbox image pulls, are encrypted across the queue, and are logged out on teardown.
  Docker Hub creds can also come from `ODDISH_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `ODDISH_DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`.
  Prefer a Docker Hub access token over an account password.
- `--retry` - Re-run an existing target instead of submitting new work (see below)
- `--qa` - With `--retry`: re-run the task-level QA job (classify every trial + synthesize the verdict) instead of retrying trials
- `--yes`, `-y` - Skip confirmation prompts (used with `--retry`)
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL
- `--json` - Emit JSON for scripts and CI; implies `--background`

### Run on ephemeral EC2

An EC2-enabled deployment can run a trial on one disposable CPU VM by selecting
the backend explicitly:

```bash
oddish run ./my-task --env ec2 -a claude-code -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
```

The hosted API rejects `--env ec2` when its operator has not enabled and fully
configured the backend. EC2 is not an automatic fallback: CPU-only hosted runs
without `--env` continue to use Daytona. V1 does not accept GPU/TPU requests,
attach mode, retained instances, or caller overrides of platform EC2 settings.
It uses a public address and key-only SSH; the instance is terminated after the
trial or cancellation.

### Re-run with `--retry`

`oddish run --retry` re-runs existing work instead of submitting new trials. It
accepts a trial, task, or experiment id — positional, `--task`, or
`--experiment` — and auto-detects the target type.

```bash
# Retry a single failed trial
oddish run <trial_id> --retry

# Retry every failed trial in a task (skip the confirmation prompt)
oddish run <task_id> --retry -y

# Retry all failed trials across an experiment
oddish run <experiment_id> --retry -y

# Re-run the task-level QA job (classify every trial + synthesize the verdict)
oddish run <task_id> --retry --qa

# Machine-readable summary of what was queued
oddish run <experiment_id> --retry -y --json
```

- Default (`--retry` alone) re-queues failed trials. For task and experiment
  targets, only trials currently in a `failed` state are retried.
- `--qa` re-runs the single task-level QA job: it re-classifies every live trial
  and synthesizes a fresh task verdict. A trial-shaped id resolves to its parent
  task; experiment targets run QA for each task.
- `--qa` requires `--retry`.
- `-y, --yes` skips the confirmation prompt; `--json` is always non-interactive.

### Sweep Config

Use `oddish run -c sweep.yaml` to run multiple agents:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: claude-code
    model_name: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    n_trials: 3
  - name: codex
    model_name: openai/gpt-5.3-codex
    n_trials: 3
  - name: nop
    n_trials: 3
  - name: oracle
    n_trials: 3

max_trial_attempts: 3
harbor:
  environment:
    kwargs:
      region: us-east
```

`max_trial_attempts` is optional. It is the total Oddish worker attempt budget
per trial, including the initial run. When omitted, Oddish keeps its default
retry behavior.

## Upload Without Running

Use `oddish upload` to register a task (or dataset of tasks) without submitting
trials, or to import existing off-oddish Harbor trial results. Re-uploading
unchanged task content is idempotent (no new version).

```bash
# Register a task or dataset
oddish upload ./my-task
oddish upload -d swebench@1.0

# Correct the selected version without growing version history
oddish upload ./my-task --overwrite-current-version

# Import Harbor job results into an existing task
oddish upload ./jobs --task <task_id>

# Upload the task, then import trials against it
oddish upload ./jobs --path ./my-task
```

Options

- `PATH` - Task dir, dataset dir, a Harbor job dir (with `result.json`), or a parent dir of job dirs
- `--path`, `-p PATH` / `--dataset`, `-d TEXT` - Task or dataset to register
- `--task-name`, `-t` / `--exclude-task-name`, `-x` / `--n-tasks`, `-l` - Task filters for dataset uploads
- `--task TEXT` - Import mode: target task ID for the imported trials
- `--experiment`, `-E TEXT` - Import mode: experiment to attach trials to (auto-generated if omitted)
- `--skip-artifacts` - Import mode: import metadata without logs/trajectories
- `--priority`, `-P TEXT` - Task row priority (default `low`)
- `--message`, `-M TEXT` - Task version description
- `--overwrite-current-version` - Replace the selected current version in place; existing trials pinned to it will resolve to the replacement content
- `--user`, `-u TEXT` - Author override
- `--quiet`, `-q` / `--json` / `--api TEXT`

## List Tasks

Use `oddish ls` to browse uploaded tasks with their latest version, trial
counts, reward summary, tags, last run time, and linked experiments.

```bash
oddish ls
oddish ls --query django
oddish ls --tag benchmark --not-tag wip
oddish ls --model openai/gpt-5 --min-steps 100 --min-duration 120
oddish ls --tool bash --tool-min bash=5 --trial-match all
oddish ls --json
```

Options

- `--query`, `-q TEXT` - Filter tasks by name
- `--tag TEXT` - Require this tag (repeatable; AND semantics)
- `--tag-any TEXT` - Match any of these tags (repeatable; OR semantics)
- `--not-tag TEXT` - Exclude tasks carrying any of these tags (repeatable)
- `--limit`, `-n INTEGER` - Maximum number of tasks to show (default 25, max 100)
- `--offset INTEGER` - Number of tasks to skip
- `--json` - Emit the raw task browser JSON response
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL

## Check Progress

Use `oddish status` to inspect the system, a task, or an experiment.
Task status tables include a `Detail` column for the current Harbor stage or
terminal reason, such as `cancelled by user`.

```bash
# System overview
oddish status

# Queue & worker scheduler diagnostics
oddish status --queue
oddish status --queue --json

# Task status
oddish status <task_id>

# Single-trial detail (status, tokens, cost, analysis)
oddish status <trial_id>

# Task version history + per-version cost rollups
oddish status <task_id> --detail

# Task version list (or a single version)
oddish status <task_id> --versions
oddish status <task_id> --versions --version 2

# Experiment status
oddish status --experiment <experiment_id> --watch

# Single JSON snapshot (no live watch) for scripts/agents
oddish status <task_id> --json
```

If a positional ID isn't found as a task, `status` automatically retries it as an experiment ID.

Options

- `TASK_ID` - Task ID to inspect when not using `--experiment`; a trial ID (`{task_id}-{index}`) shows a single-trial detail view, and an unmatched ID falls back to experiment lookup
- `--experiment`, `-e TEXT` - Inspect an experiment instead of a task
- `--detail` - Show a task's version history + per-version cost rollups (`GET /tasks/{id}/detail`; task ID required)
- `--versions` - Show a task's version list; add `--version N` for a single version
- `--version INTEGER` - With `--versions`, show only this version number
- `--queue`, `-Q` - Show queue & worker scheduler diagnostics instead of a task/experiment (see below)
- `--stale-after INTEGER` - Minutes without a heartbeat before a trial/job counts as stale (with `--queue`; default 15)
- `--watch`, `-w` - Poll until the task or experiment finishes
- `--verbose`, `-v` - Extra detail in the system overview
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL
- `--json` - Emit a single JSON snapshot (no live watch)

### Queue & Worker Diagnostics

`oddish status --queue` aggregates the scheduler's `/admin/*` diagnostics so you
can debug "queued but not running", stuck slots, and zombie/stale workers
**without direct database access**. It shows:

- **Queue health** — total queued/running, per-queue-key capacity
  (`Queued` ready, `Sched` waiting on retry backoff, `Running`, `Limit`, `Fill`,
  oldest-queued age), and the dispatcher/reconciler heartbeat ages (is the
  scheduler alive?).
- **Slot leases** — how many `queue_slots` are leased per queue key.
- **Stuck / orphaned** — trials whose heartbeat has gone stale and tasks left
  active with no downstream work, including the worker id / slot / last
  heartbeat for each stale trial sample.
- **Worker jobs** — per-`(kind, status)` counts and recent failures (hosted
  Oddish only; omitted on a self-hosted core server).

```bash
oddish status --queue                  # human-readable panel
oddish status --queue --json           # combined JSON for agents/scripts
oddish status --queue --stale-after 30 # widen the stale-heartbeat window
```

On hosted Oddish these diagnostics require a **full-scope** API key
(`read`/`tasks` keys get a clear error); a self-hosted core server applies no
auth.

## Stream Live Logs

Use `oddish logs` to stream a **running** trial's transcript (agent messages,
tool calls, tool results) plus a running token/cost estimate, without waiting
for the trial to finish.

```bash
# One page of whatever has streamed so far
oddish logs <trial_id>

# Poll until the trial ends
oddish logs <trial_id> --follow
```

Notes

- Live transcripts exist only for supported agents (`claude-code`, `codex`,
  `cursor-cli`, `mini-swe-agent`); other agents show no live events.
- Live events are short-lived: they are purged once the trial reaches a
  terminal state. For finished trials, use `oddish pull` (or
  `GET /trials/{id}/logs`) to fetch the permanent logs from S3.
- The cost line is a live estimate; the authoritative cost is settled on the
  trial when it finishes.

Options

- `TRIAL_ID` - Trial ID to stream live transcript + cost for
- `--follow`, `-f` - Poll for new events until the trial ends
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL

## Cancel In-Flight Runs

Use `oddish cancel` to stop queued or running work without deleting the task
itself. Completed trials are preserved. By default it cancels all active task
runs; use `--qa` to cancel only the task-level QA job.

```bash
# Cancel all active runs for a task
oddish cancel <task_id>

# Cancel only the in-flight QA job (classification + verdict)
oddish cancel <task_id> --qa
oddish cancel <trial_id> --qa   # a trial id resolves to its parent task
```

Options

- `TASK_ID` - Task or trial ID to cancel; with `--qa`, a trial ID resolves to its parent task
- `--qa` - Cancel the task's in-flight QA job only (classification + verdict)
- `--force`, `-f` - Skip the confirmation prompt
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL
- `--json` - Emit the cancellation result as JSON (implies `--force`)

## Backfill Analysis

Use `oddish backfill-analysis` to (re)run trial analysis (LLM trajectory classification + task verdict) for an experiment, a task, or a single trial. Pass exactly one of `--experiment`, `--task`, or `--trial`. By default only trials with no successful analysis yet are filled, and trials already analyzed (including ones whose analysis previously failed) are reused — pass `--force` to redo failed or already-complete analyses. The task verdict is recomputed either way.

```bash
oddish backfill-analysis --task <task_id>
oddish backfill-analysis --trial <trial_id> --force
oddish backfill-analysis --experiment <experiment_id>
```

Options

- `--experiment TEXT` - Re-analyze all trials in an experiment
- `--task TEXT` - Re-analyze all trials in a task
- `--trial TEXT` - Re-analyze a single trial
- `--force` - Re-run analysis even for trials already analyzed. With `--trial`, re-runs just that trial; with `--task` or `--experiment`, re-runs all their trials.
- `--json` - Emit machine-readable output.
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL

## View Costs

Use `oddish costs` to see billable-spend accounting **without direct DB access**.
By default it shows the org-wide breakdown; pass `--user <id>` for one user's
billed spend. Admin-only on hosted Oddish (a full-scope API key); not available
on a self-hosted core server.

```bash
# Org-wide spend over the last 7 days (default)
oddish costs

# All-time, machine-readable
oddish costs --window-days 0 --json

# One user's billed spend over 30 days
oddish costs --user <user_id> --window-days 30
```

Options

- `--user TEXT` - Show one user's billed spend (by id) instead of the org-wide breakdown
- `--window-days INTEGER` - Trailing window in days; `0` = all-time (default 7)
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL
- `--json` - Emit the raw cost breakdown JSON

## Download Outputs

Use `oddish pull` to download logs and artifacts from Oddish to local files.

```bash
# Pull a single trial
oddish pull <trial_id>

# Pull an experiment into a custom directory
oddish pull <experiment_id> --include-task-files --out ./downloads

# Inspect a trial's raw S3 layout instead of downloading (DB key vs actual objects)
oddish pull <trial_id> --debug-files
oddish pull <trial_id> --debug-files --json
```

By default, files are written to `./.oddish/<target>`. Re-pulling is idempotent — files already on disk that match the remote size are skipped, so `--watch` only downloads new or changed artifacts on each iteration and stops when the target reaches a terminal state.

Options

- `TARGET` - Trial ID, task ID, or experiment ID
- `--type [trial|task|experiment]` - Force target type instead of auto-resolving
- `--out`, `-o PATH` - Output directory
- `--logs/--no-logs` - Include trial logs
- `--files/--no-files` - Include trial or task artifacts
- `--structured` - Save structured trial logs in addition to normal logs
- `--include-task-files` - Include task-level files for task or experiment targets
- `--debug-files` - List a trial's raw S3 inventory (stored `trial_s3_key` vs computed prefix vs the objects that actually exist) instead of downloading. Trial targets only; useful for diagnosing "did the upload land where the DB thinks it did?"
- `--watch`, `-w` - Keep pulling while the run is in progress
- `--interval INTEGER` - Poll interval in seconds for `--watch`
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL
- `--json` - Print the pull manifest as JSON instead of progress output

## Targeting a PR Preview

Every open PR gets its own isolated preview stack: a Modal app
(`oddish-pr-<N>`), a Supabase Postgres branch, and a Vercel preview build —
provisioned automatically by `.github/workflows/pr-preview.yml`. To point
the CLI at a preview from your laptop:

```bash
# 1. Point at the preview backend by PR number.
export ODDISH_PREVIEW_PR=35

# 2. Sign in at the preview Vercel URL (printed in the PR's
#    Actions step summary), create an API key in the dashboard,
#    and export it. Preview keys are formatted `ok_pr-<N>_<hex>`
#    so a stray paste into a prod context is visually obvious.
export ODDISH_API_KEY=ok_pr-35_…

# 3. Run as usual — every command now hits the preview Modal +
#    Supabase branch DB.
oddish run /path/to/task --agent gemini-cli --model google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview
oddish status
```

API URL resolution order is `ODDISH_API_URL` (explicit) >
`ODDISH_PREVIEW_PR` (derived) > prod default. Forks change the URL
pattern by setting `ODDISH_PREVIEW_URL_TEMPLATE` (with `{n}` for the
PR number).

## Combine Experiments

Use `oddish combine` to merge two or more experiments into a brand-new
result experiment. The source experiments are left untouched; their task
memberships and finished trials (with artifacts) are copied into the new
experiment, so you get a single rolled-up view.

```bash
# Combine two experiments (by ID or name)
oddish combine <experiment_a> <experiment_b>

# Name the result and combine three experiments
oddish combine <exp_a> <exp_b> <exp_c> --name nightly-rollup

# Reference source artifacts in place instead of duplicating them
oddish combine <exp_a> <exp_b> --no-copy-artifacts
```

In-flight trials (still pending/queued/running) have no result to combine
and are skipped; the response reports how many were copied vs. skipped.

Options

- `SOURCE_EXPERIMENT_IDS...` - Two or more experiment IDs or names to combine
- `--name`, `-n TEXT` - Name for the result experiment (auto-generated if omitted)
- `--copy-artifacts / --no-copy-artifacts` - Duplicate each copied trial's
  artifacts so the result is fully independent (default), or reference the
  source artifacts in place (cheaper, shared storage)
- `--json` - Print the raw JSON response
- `--api-url`, `-u TEXT` - Override the API URL

## Collect Trials into a Shared Collection

Use `oddish collect` to gather trials — from whole tasks and/or explicit trial
IDs — into a new read-only **collection experiment**, and (by default) publish
it with a public share link. Source tasks and trials are referenced, not
copied.

```bash
# Collect the current-version trials of two tasks and publish
oddish collect --task <task_a> --task <task_b> --name my-collection

# Mix tasks and individual trials; keep it private
oddish collect <trial_id> --task <task_id> --no-publish

# Machine-readable output (includes public_token / public_url when published)
oddish collect --task <task_id> --json
```

Options

- `TRIAL_ID...` - Optional trial IDs to include (combine freely with `--task`)
- `--task`, `-t TEXT` - Task ID or name whose current-version trials are linked (repeatable)
- `--name`, `-n TEXT` - Collection name (default `collection`)
- `--publish/--no-publish` - Create a public read-only share link (default: publish). Publishing requires a full-scope API key.
- `--json` - Print the raw JSON response
- `--api-url`, `-u TEXT` - Override the API URL

`oddish experiment create` is the lower-level sibling: it builds a collection
from explicit trial IDs only, never publishes, and requires `--name`:

```bash
oddish experiment create --name my-set <trial_id_1> <trial_id_2>
```

### Editing a Collection

A collection can be edited after it's created, and its share link keeps
working — the URL never changes.

```bash
# merge another experiment's trials in
oddish experiment add <collection_id> --from <other_experiment_id>

# add specific trials, or a task pinned to one version
oddish experiment add <collection_id> <trial_id_1> <trial_id_2> --task <task_id>@16

# drop a task from the collection (all versions of it)
oddish experiment remove <collection_id> --task <task_id>

# rename it
oddish experiment rename <collection_id> --name "21-task rollup"
```

`remove` only unlinks — the trials stay in their home experiment with their
artifacts intact. `add` needs a `TASKS`-scoped key; `remove` and `rename`
require an admin API key, the same gate `oddish delete` uses. `remove` refuses
to take out the last of a collection's trials — if you want the collection
gone, use `oddish delete` to remove it entirely. (This is a guard on the
`remove` command, not a guarantee about collections in general: deleting the
underlying trials with `oddish delete --trial` can still leave a collection
with nothing to show.)

## Delete Data

Use `oddish delete` to delete tasks, experiments, or trials. Against hosted
Oddish (oddish.app), only trial deletion (`--trial`) is available; whole-task
and whole-experiment deletion require a self-hosted instance.

```bash
# Delete an experiment
oddish delete --experiment <experiment_id>

# Delete a task
oddish delete <task_id>

# Delete one or more trials and emit a JSON result
oddish delete --trial <trial_id> --json
```

Options

- `TASK_ID` - Task ID to delete when not using `--experiment` (self-host only)
- `--experiment`, `-e TEXT` - Delete an experiment instead of a task (self-host only)
- `--trial`, `-t TEXT` - Delete one or more trials (repeatable); works against hosted Oddish
- `--yes`, `-y` - Skip confirmation prompts
- `--api-url`, `-u TEXT` - Override the API URL
- `--json` - Emit the delete result as JSON (implies `--yes`)

## Share an Experiment

Use `oddish publish` to make an experiment publicly viewable (read-only) and
get a shareable URL; `oddish unpublish` revokes it. Public viewers never see
trial analysis or task verdicts. (Both require a hosted/cloud deployment.)

```bash
# Publish and print the public URL
oddish publish <experiment_id>

# Machine-readable output (public URL + token)
oddish publish <experiment_id> --json

# Stop sharing
oddish unpublish <experiment_id>
```

Options

- `EXPERIMENT_ID` - Experiment ID (or name) to publish/unpublish
- `--api TEXT` - Override the API URL
- `--json` - Emit the share status as JSON

## Drag-and-drop import (UI)

The dashboard's **Tasks** page has an **Import** button next to the
search input that opens the same flow as `oddish upload`, but driven
from the browser. Drop one or both of:

- a Harbor task zip (e.g. `zip -r my-task.zip my-task`)
- a Harbor run zip — either a single job dir (with `result.json`) or a
  parent dir of job dirs

The dialog accepts:

- **Task only** → registers a new task version (or no-op when content
  is unchanged).
- **Run only** → imports every Harbor trial in the zip into the target
  task ID you provide.
- **Task + run** → uploads the task first, then imports the trials
  against it (the UI equivalent of `oddish upload ./jobs --path ./my-task`).

The optional **Experiment name** field maps to `--experiment`; leaving
it blank auto-generates a fresh experiment, matching the CLI default.
**Skip artifacts** maps to `--skip-artifacts`. Re-uploading the same
task content is idempotent — content-hash unchanged → no new version.

For very large archives or scripted/CI flows, prefer the CLI: the UI
caps each uploaded zip at 1 GiB.

## Benchmark Metrics (metrics.json)

A task can report structured benchmark numbers by having its **verifier**
write `metrics.json` next to `reward.txt` (i.e. `/logs/verifier/metrics.json`
inside the sandbox). Oddish persists the parsed object onto the trial and
returns it as the trial's `result` in the API.

Contract:

- A single JSON **object**, at most **64 KiB**. Anything else (missing,
  malformed, oversized, non-object) is ignored — metrics can never fail a
  trial whose reward already settled.
- Include `"schema_version": 1` so downstream consumers can evolve.
- Recommended keys for performance benchmarks (all optional):
  `latency_ms`, `step_time_ms`, `ttft_ms`, `throughput_tokens_per_sec`,
  `mxu_utilization_pct`, and for MoE workloads `routing_overhead_ms`,
  `gating_overhead_ms`, `ici_time_ms`, `expert_load_balance`.
  Task-specific keys are fine alongside.

```bash
# tests/test.sh
echo 1 > /logs/verifier/reward.txt
cat > /logs/verifier/metrics.json <<'JSON'
{"schema_version": 1, "ttft_ms": 12.5, "throughput_tokens_per_sec": 4300}
JSON
```

## Test Results (ctrf.json)

Test-based tasks can expose passed, failed, skipped, pending, and other counts
by writing a [Common Test Report Format](https://ctrf.io/) report to
`/logs/verifier/ctrf.json`. Current Harbor tasks commonly do this with
`pytest-json-ctrf`:

```bash
uvx --with pytest --with pytest-json-ctrf \
  pytest --ctrf /logs/verifier/ctrf.json /tests -rA
```

Oddish keeps the full report with the trial artifacts and persists only its
compact `results.summary` counts, `results.tool.name`, and the trial-relative
report artifact path under the reserved `trial.result._verifier` key. The
dashboard shows those counts as a small passed/total line in the trial
drawer's summary. Missing, malformed, or oversized CTRF reports are ignored
and never change the settled `reward`; verifiers without a test report simply
show no test line.
